marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Amazing pool on the roof, very good breakfast The menu for dining at room was a bit poor. Unfortunately the building site next to the hotel was invading the peace"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Clean, ftiendly staff, unbelievable pool, very good gym, fast wifi, good bathroom, early check-in without problem. Transfer from and to airport Food in restaurants could be much better, construction site was nearby, thus it was too noisy at the day time "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great place, loved it!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great food and great rooms. Great price. The bell man Shehan provides an excellent and professional service - he is to be commended. Will definitely be back next time I am in Colombo. Enjoyed everything 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Perfect place for a lazy day after the trip. Beautiful rooftop garden with an infinity pool, tasty buffet with Sri Lankan options and very comfortable rooms. Everything was fine."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The service was great. Location. Family comfort
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great place with amazing rooms and staff! Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Although the staff was highly kind and very helpful and friendly, the hotel owners should wducate them a little more so that they can give more accurate information to the guests."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff were excellent. Special thanks to Supun , the lobby manager and our taxi driver also named Supun. They really  gave us a taste of top SriLankan service. Our twilight tour of Colombo with Supun was just fabulous. Hotel was clean, restaurants top class. Only stayed two days, but will certainly use this hotel when we return to Colombo. Didn’t like the lift to the mall allowing access to the hotel lobby. Thought this was a security risk."
marino-beach-colombo, 2.9 ,"Nothing Dishonest staff
Lack of management and accountability 
I booked a panoramic king room for 2 nights, despite informing the hotel 5 times before I arrived that I had booked the room from the night before so I could check in on arrival early in the morning they STILL gave the room to another guest.
This was bad enough but at check in they neglected to tell me this, the receptionist happily billed my credit card and gave me a room which when I opened the door instantly realised it wasn’t the room I had booked.
The receptionist did not apologise and was completely disinterested in the fact I was not given the correct room, I was then told I ‘should’ have been there the day before so I explained again that I had booked the room from the previous night so I could check in on arrival.
What followed was 14 hours of being promised my room would be ready only to be told it wasn’t, this went on for hours to the point where I took my case and said I wanted to go to another hotel.
They gave me a ‘suite’ which was nowhere near what I would call a suite, I was exhausted at this point having travelled for 15 hours.
I could go on and on but in a nutshell in no way is this a 5 star hotel or even a 4 star hotel. The staff are incompetent, the hotel manager is elusive and would not show up to resolve the issue.
In my almost 30 years of travelling I have never encountered such poor customer service, dishonest and disinterested staff.
I will add that at the 11th hour they tried to make up for it by giving me a free dinner and refunded one night but this in no way made up for the catastrophic experience I had which completely ruined my first impression of Sri Lanka.
This hotel is not worth the money, the location is poor and run down. 
There are far better hotels and locations in Colombo.

marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"The room is big n clean The staffs is not so friendly, especially the limo side. When u ask for water must make sure ask whether chargeable "
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Friendly staff This hotel charged me more than the price shown on Booking.comThe price was USD 92 however they charged me USD 158 with no explanation to it. I would like to advise future customers to be aware of those unexplainable charges. I agrees for some taxes but this is extremely at higher side . Also a lobby manager who was in the lobby at the time I left wasn’t a customer oriented he was swollen headed guy and felt like he was not suitable for this job..."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,sea said service is nothing....and staffs are not traind as  well...need more ....etc
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Clean room, comfortable bed Room service food was cold .  I had asked for car to be ordered for airport and they didn't do it, even after I had checked to ensure it was done.  Poolside service was terrible. I has to ask for drinks menu, staff never followed up to see if more was wanted "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,It is new hotel but still they have to improve their managment Poor managment
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Good design Good material choices. You can’t spend time on balconies wich is very noisy and disturbing,No cellular network inside"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,some noise middle of the night and it is really disturbing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Facilities good and nice view. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"pool is superb. well cleaned Food was really goodroom was so quite and comfortableMany TV channels were available with good selectionParking was ample and trouble free  So friendly staff Good place to relax door lock was malfunctioning. Burglar alarm rings until it pushes so hard"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Breakfast menu good and the rooms were comfy. Mosquitos inside the room and balcony. The breakfast menu was always the same not much variety. The wait for tea was very long and the tea cups nearly burnt my fingers
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Very clean and new  Late of service or they are busy ,, some time there is noise from upstairs also in booking they are not clear about the hotel side views"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Staff were not hospitable. Not punctual in getting the cab ready at the said time. Construction work still going on, felt cheated when they informed at check in."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Very clean hotell and new , the pool on the top is spacious. Check in and check out, the services in s also too slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Huge room, lovely bed and bathroom It's a brand new hotel, so one expects teething issues.  We arrived very late the first night and couldn't figure out where the noise outside our room was coming from.  Called reception at 1am but nothing came of that.  When we woke we could see the culprit - our room was a few metres from the industrial extraction fans that formed part of the air con for the building and there was no soundproofing.   Reception staff were vaguely accommodating but the two other rooms they eventually showed us were no good either - one was just as noisy, the other smelled/damp.  So we checked out and moved somewhere else.  (Staff in general don't seem to know what they are doing - e.g. the guy on the main door directed us straight to the underground garage on arrival rather than letting us unload our bags)"
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"Deducted full amount from the credit card and blocked another amount and kept it without releasing , had to call the hotel more than 10 times , every time they apologise and promise to call back but never called back Staff is not very customer focus and trained"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,The room was really clean and tidy and all the staff I dealt with were really kind and helpful. Power outage at 1am and 2am making the room very uncomfortable. Not able to adjust my climate control below 24 degrees. No bar next to the pool either. Also the construction noises were a bit much. Why I couldn't have been put in a room away from it all I don't know.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The staff was really nice.   The hotel provided small classy details like a body scrub brush, slipper, robes, toothbrush and toiletries.    Had good international cable choices.   There was great views of the ocean.     It was close to everything. It seemed like it just opened and needed some finishing touches.    Like the big dark useless room with chairs and tables too uncomfortable to be in that is part of the lobby.   Needs some lighting.  It lessened the luxury feel of the place.  Also, when I arrived, I was put in a room that had construction outside.   I asked for another room and it was no problem and I was moved.   But my first thought was why did they put me in a room next to construction if there were others available."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Location, venue, facilities and room very clean with all the furnitures so new! I’ve been called at 5am to my direct room phone and force to wake up just to pay 5$ for a room service.
Crazy ones!
They really apologize for this happening and offered me a free of charge late check out."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"comfortable beds Spartan lobby. Rooms on 3rd floor to be avoided as they adjoin a terrace that's littered with cigarette buttsVery slow with Check in"
yala-village, 7.1 ,Location within national park. Excellent WiFi even in the chalet.  Breakfast and A la Carte were excellent.  Happy to accommodate late check out. Shower in our chalet was lovely. Extra bed for our daughter wasn’t made up for our arrival.   The bed was left outside on the veranda and we had to ask for it to be made up for our daughter.  Unfortunately this didn’t give us the 5 star feel that we were anticipating.
yala-village, 6.2 ,We had a take away breakfast that we took on the safari Too much security.  Feel like a prisoner.
yala-village, 6.7 ,"The resort is located within Yala park, beautifully surrounded by the ocean, the jungle and a waterhole where crocs, buffalos and wild boars hang out. The facilities are nice and clean, the room is simple but beautiful , the bed is comfortable, shower is great, and the pool area is perfect. Everything you should expect from such an expensive place. However I still DO NOT RECOMMEND to stay at this place.  When we looked at the reviews and pictures, we were really excited to come to Cinnamon Wild, however from the moment we tried to be in contact with the hotel, our excitement faded. We tried several times to contact the hotel, via booking.com and via phone calls, no one ever replied to our messages and the staff we got on the phone wasn’t helpful at all, and gave us a phone number that doesn’t work. It’s only when we called the head office a second time that we finally got someone who was helpful and gave us a real phone number. We had to contact the booking.com customer service to get ahold of the hotel and someone finally got back to us on the day we arrived there, absolutely useless! The hotel is located far out of the main towns, within the vicinity of the park, but yet they didn’t help us at all to arrange a pick up to reach the hotel, nor gave us further directions. Once there, the front desk staff was absolutely useless, not friendly and clueless to our situation, when we mentioned we tried to contact them , their reaction was just a “oh”. We were expecting a much better treatment and attention for such a famous resort. The other thing that disappointed us was the food. Even though the menu looks good, the quality of the food is terrible!! Ingredients are not fresh at all, and the flavors are almost non existent, even the fruit juices taste bad.. again, for such a pricy  hotel, and a pricy menu, good quality and freshness is excepted. The last thing was the safari. We booked with the hotel as it is convenient and gives us peace of mind that we will get everything that we pay for. Know that the safaris booked via this hotel are double price than what you pay through an agency, which could be ok if we would get some extra quality service for the extra money we pay, but of course not! The only advantage is that you can walk to the Jeep waiting for you by the hotel, and that’s all."
yala-village, 6.7 ,"Excellent location right in Yala National Park with wildlife across the property  Not much option other than buffet for food
"
yala-village, 5.0 ,"Lovely looking over the lake in the evening Food was disgusting and hugely over priced, very unauthentic and really quite bad - for £10-15 a main course or £60 per couple to do the buffet. Feels like a hotel you are just waiting to do safari from - but if so you could spend a lot less to go somewhere with good food!Its really targetted at tour groups who are coming in for one night only."
yala-village, 6.2 ,"We booked packed breakfast to eat in Yala park but staff didn't tell me the price when I was booking.  We saw wild pig, crocdile, peacock in the hotel. The light in hotel is so dark, we couldn't find things in the luggage!"
yala-village, 7.1 ,The monkeys were great. Some wild life is present around. Convenient location. The breakfast was fulfilling. The manager agreed to refund the money overcharged. The rooms were too small. There was no life guard on the beach. There was no provision for swimming in the sea.
yala-village, 6.7 ,Child beds were not great condition  and no extra bedding provided unless requested. Bar food quality was basic and portions could be larger.
yala-village, 7.1 ,"Breakfast and dinner buffet was nice but overpriced After having a meal and drinks was told they would apply a discount to the bill for getting part of the order wrong but they didn’t when I questioned they made out I was lying, I never asked for any discount but it was offered so felt it should of been done"
yala-village, 7.1 ,We did not appreciate that the safari tour was the same price as in the high season. The majority of the park was closed. The 3 hour safari was consumed by 2hrs of driving time to the small part of the park that was open far from the resort. We appreciate that we chose this property during the parks closure time but for half the usual experience it should have been discounted.
yala-village, 6.7 ,"The rooftop bar made nice cocktails. Nothing more good to say about this hotel.... We got a “Beach chalet”, and you get the impression that the bungalow is on the Beach - it is not. But from our porch we had a glimse of the Ocean.
In our room the loft was painted over several places - it was obvious it was to hide the mold underneath it. 
The Safari in Yala is horrible - the only animal there is really present is - the Safari Jeeps. It is really horrible. We booked a whole-day Safari, but left the park before lunchtime. We felt sorry for the elefants, who seemed stressed out by so many cars... 
The food in this hotel was really horrible, and the breakfast boxes we got for the Safari - even worse.
"
yala-village, 4.6 ,"Close to jungle  Our experience was very disappointing.
We were surprised at how unhelpful the front desk staff were compared to everywhere else we have stayed in Sri Lanka. Weren’t at all interested in providing a good experience, merely fulfilling their basic role at the front desk. They acted like robots when you asked them a question...not the Sri Lankan charm we were used to! We were just a number to them.
We stayed in the Jungle Chalet and it was SO DARK. The only natural light in the room came from the front door. My husband asked if we could get an upgrade considering I was 20 weeks pregnant and it was a flat NO...even thou the hotel was very quiet, following the Easter bombing and Corona virus outbreak (this is something we’d already received twice at other hotels without asking). The rooms were really angular shapes which left hardly any room to actually get changed in, I wanted to spend as little time in this room as possible.
The restaurant way overpriced, because there are no other options nearby. The buffet for 1 person without drinks is equivalent to a dinner for 2 in any other nice restaurant in Sri Lanka with drinks, and quality is probably lower.
Staff in the restaurant were friendly and helpful as you’d expect.
The safari offered through the hotel was twice the price of local operators for effectively an identical experience. This felt like a very big tax on convenience, and another example of how guests are milked for as much money as possible rather than providing value for money.
A good example came at the end when we called the front desk to ask for help with the bags as we’d like to check out (paths are all gravel so suitcase wheels don’t work). A man appeared almost immediately, knocking on the door. Not to help, but to inspect the mini bar to make sure weren’t lying about having not taken anything. This was their priority throughout our stay.
Overall really not happy and I want to warn people as how this is rated so highly I don’t know! "
yala-village, 7.0 ,"You can't fault the room we had, the restaurant was excellent with a huge buffet selection for both breakfast and dinner. The pool area was good with plenty of room and a large pool. We were lucky to get all of the nights we stayed at a competitive D,B&B rate via Booking.com had we paid full price my opinion would probably be different! My biggest disappointment was the hotel grounds. The descriptions given suggest a far more open set up but in actual fact everywhere is surrounded by high bushes, the views are very limited and access to the lake area very limited too. The security guards won't let you put a foot outside the gates for safety reasons and yet hotel staff can be seen walking along both the main entrance route and the service road. The hotels insistence they walk you back to your room all adds to the fear they manage to instill in their guests. Yes, there are wild animals in the area but the likes of the Wild Boar are habituated will even respond when called and don't present any threat whatsoever, the Water Buffalo likewise have no interest in human contact. Yes, maybe an Elephant was recently in the hotel grounds but with all the staff that they have they would soon be able to change security arrangements for their guests. Safety should be a personal choice , great that escorts are available if requested but having experiences of much wilder locations than this I have no need of a minder.My other observation is on pricing. I daresay if you have paid full price to stay there you expect everything else to be a high price too. Once at the hotel though you are isolated from everywhere else and might have to rely on the hotel to provide services such as safari trips, taxis etc. OK, they charge R850 for a bottle of beer which is 400 more than anywhere else I have been so far but I don't have an issue with that. A full day safari was quoted at $280 for two people, immediately reduced by a 15% special offer when I told them I could do it for half that price.In actual fact I paid $100 for one arranged in Tissa, exactly the same vehicle, excellent guide and picked up at the hotel. Come on Cinnamon stop being greedy."
yala-village, 7.1 ,"The pool looking out over the lake, bordered by the ocean....wow!! Also, you can’t get any closer to Yalla Park. And the monkeys and wild boards all through the grounds are amazing.  The hotel and rooms need some serious love. And the staff clearly need some more care and reward towards better employee engagement. They work hard, and long shifts but seem exhausted. "
yala-village, 5.0 ,Location is in the wild and close to Yala park. Swimming pool is also okay. Lots not to like. It is ridiculously expensive for what you are getting. BBQ dinner at 100 USD and a bottle of wine at 65 USD. Food is pretty average compare to the rest of Sri Lanka. 
yala-village, 7.1 ,The staff is friendly  About booking hotel the hotel price is showed in the message why can't help me book in same price because I booked two room in different price the hotel not help for that
yala-village, 5.0 ,"Jungle chalets are very dated and secluded, I expressed my insecurity being a solo traveller and could I please limit my stay to 1 night as I was very afraid and was given the complete runaround. The manager promised to contact me within 2 days to negotiate a refund 5 days later I’m still  waiting. "
yala-village, 5.8 ,Proximity to the national park. The sofa in the reception and the chairs in the room were not comfortable.  The food was very disappointing compare to the other cinnamon hotels we have stayed at. Not enough seating capacity in the restaurant for all the in house guest. The room needs a revamp . The price they charge for food doesn't match amount and quality of food you get on your plate. We understand we were in the wild but dogs barking in the night was unacceptable.
yala-village, 6.7 ,Location  Undertrained staff!!! Cleanliness can be improved !
yala-village, 6.2 ,"Nice rooms. The idea of wild Buffalo and wild boar walking among the guests is very nice Beautiful place, nice rooms, so why am i rating it low? We ordered 2 triple rooms. They tried to put us in double rooms. After we demanded what we paid for they put us in two distant rooms. One for the kids and another for the parents. And they don't allow walking alone between rooms without an hotel escort. And they wont provide a flashlight for walking. And they won't provide an extra key so i can visit my kids at night. And they dont even have room to room calling. Out of 12 different hotels we visited in Sri Lanka, ranging from 40 to 400 $ a night, this was the worst night for us.And by the way, the restaurant is a smoking zone, and the crew wouldn't even ask smokers to move"
miridiya-lake-resort, 6.0 ,"We had nice rooms as we have requested.
They have a nice pool surrounded with huge trees. There were two of them in the reception but they didn't want to welcome their guests. After that a lady came from back office & welcomed us.  At the C/O time also she came to greet us. She is the GRE i guess. We were on H/B but foods were not tasty. "
miridiya-lake-resort, 10 ,I liked natural lake view & garden. Nothing 
miridiya-lake-resort, 5.0 ,I liked the garden so much. It was big garden. I didn’t like the room. I didn’t like the food. Didn’t have the spread. Food was ran out.

Rooms are very clean, very comfortable beds, beautiful view, great room service, can enjoy quiet stay. Very hospitable and friendly reception, allowed us to check out later in the day free of charge. At times it felt that there is not enough staff to cater all the guests. Whilst staff at the reception was very hospitable, can't say that about all the employees. Morning buffet is very busy, defiantelly need more staff to cater for all the customers."
shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,Nice and clean.. the connected rooms where very luxury. I really enjoyed my stay. The restaurant is also nice. They don’t have offers for tourists trips around the town... not good in marketing their location.

amaya-beach, 5.4 ,"Nicely decorated room and good location.  Enjoyed massage at the spa. Service & food in pool bar was poor. One Sandwich took over 40 minutes and tasted cheap. No-one checked back on us - the table was cleared by a flock of birds. Reported our concerns to the staff and they didn't seem to care.
Breakfast was below average for the quality of the hotel.
Please be aware that the price quoted on booking.com does not include tax."
amaya-beach, 6.7 ,Reasonable price. Spacious rooms. Good variety of food for lunch and dinner. Noisy. More adapted to young groups or families.

amaya-beach, 9.0 ,"Liked everything about the hotel. However, we couldn’t have a proper dip in the sea because of the corals and so on. But, the the sea was calm. Good for even little toddlers. We didn’t like the prices for lunch and dinner per head as we it is way too much for a local. It is just over Rs.4000/= per head!! If it was reasonable we would have taken both lunch and dinner at the hotel. There was a good place just 5 minutes walk from the hotel for both lunch and dinner and it was very reasonable."

Do a cooking class at The Kitchen Garden Ella Restaurant & Cooking classes, NOW thats good food! Perhaps hire this lady as your chef."
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Amazing view and location, great staff very helpful and friendly"
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Breakfast was incredible, made even better by the view. The staff were superb and catered to every need. A special mention is to Anupa (the manager I believe), he was absolutely superb and provided probably the best service we've ever had. The location is absolutely perfect, close proximity to the strip but just far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. Also very close to access the main hikes, Little Adams Peak and Ella Rock. We actually got engaged during our time there and EKHO Ella made it even more special. Thanks again. Nothing."

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 6.2 ,"Staff - thanks to Preshan. Little to do location wise, gym was average for a resort of this size and overall cost didn't compare to the service and experience.  We have stayed at much better resorts for a 1/3 of the price."

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.0 ,"Location is stunning. Beautiful beach with all that you could want for a restful, getaway from it all stay. The staff are incredible, their main aim is to meet guests needs and to ensure that each guest feels ‘special’. ‘The only downside for us is that it is isolated. There is nothing but the hotel. Wonderful for a few nights, perhaps a week to totally unwind. The rooms are spacious but do need updating with more modern touches   , particularly the bathrooms. Lighting and mirrors that have demister properties  would be useful. Bedroom furniture is clunky and needs to be of better quality."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Amazing staff! Fabulous location! Great food!  The beach is not for swimming but if you walk a little further to the next beach you can swim there. Other than this we could not fault the hotel.

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"Breakfast spread was great as were the onsite restaurants, staff was attentive and polite throughout, fantastic view from the rooms, located close enough to the main section of the beach yet isolated enough for peace and quiet The lack of flexibility in waiving (even partially) of my unused final night's stay that was requested before check-in was a little disappointing"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Got treated by the head chef to some crab curry, amazing. Got upgraded to the 9th floor which have us an amazing view of the bay. The entrance lobby is also gorgeous. The dining area could sometimes be a bit loud."

golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"New hotel with very nice, clean, spacious rooms - right on the beach. The staff were friendly and helpful, and it was easy to get into town from there, or to walk along the beach. Only real let down - breakfast spread was decent, but all COLD - cold beans and cold hash browns are not enticing. They desperately need some food warmers - should be an extremely easy fix - other than that a great stay"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.3 ,"# The bed was great, we never slept that well during the whole Sri Lanka trip
# Fantastic new and silent AC in the room 
# Free beach towels and sunbeds for the beach
# Fresh and really nice breakfast that offers something new every morning 
# Very sweet and friendly staff 
# Close to the main top eateries in the village (check TripAdvisor ;)
 # We stayed 4 nights but the minibar has not been restocked once (even though we took some stuff on the first night; the spots just remained empty).
# There's coffee in the room but no spoons.
# No bathrobe and slippers in the room as advertised. 
# Bathroom smelled of sewage. 
# What bewildered us the most was that even though they seem to have a well equipped restaurant and bar, you wouldn't know about it. There's no menu in the room. There are bars left and right at the beach where you can get stuff but the hotel's own bar doesn't seem to care to offer anything to their guests. That's so sad, they have so much to offer! 
# The beach bar next to the hotel's beach is a great spot for drinks and snacks but plays awful music all day long at high volume, no escape. Also, dogs everywhere. But of course that's true for beaches everywhere in these parts."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.5 ,Pool facilities close by 6 for cleaning meant to be open by 7.30 am but waited for this to open also.Admittedly there was heavy rain but had been keen fir a relaxing swim.Was great once open
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 6.7 ,"Pool, beach, view and breakfast. Honestly place could be just amazing if the staff was better. Very unfriendly and lazy staff. Had to ask for my room to be cleaned everyday even though the sign had been on the door more than 5 hours. Every day! Meanwhile the staff is chilling in the bar all day long. Most can barely understand simple English, sad and frustrating for an international establishment. Icing on the cake they organised some sort of school party with 40 people in the garden (where hotel guests can actually rest and enjoy the swimming pool/sea usually) and like if it wasn't enough turned the music so loud I could feel the basses from my room. Completely unacceptable. Hated the place that day and honestly felt compeled to leave the hotel until late afternoon. Will never go back, ever."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 2.5 ,"Nothing at all Service of the Security staff is very poor. Toilet was not cleaned properly toilet, used  paper towels and linen  towels were all over the toilet. Bed and pillows are not comfortable."

golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.0 ,"The staff were nice and the hotel itself is relatively new. There was a very loud party taking place during the late afternoon/evening we arrived. The staff assured us it would finish by 10.30 pm and it did, but it wasn't the most welcoming atmosphere as the families holding said party had pretty much commandeered the pool and outdoor area. The loud music kept us inside our room when it would have been nice to enjoy the balcony on our first evening there. 
The hotel's restaurant needs to improve. As typical with many Sri Lankan hotels at this price point, ordering anything outside rice and curry is a risk. Don't order the pizza.

golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,The staff was so nice! They helped me arrange a surprise birthday cake for my boyfriend's birthday and prepared everything! The room was big and very comfortable and the location was right on the beach!

sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"Very nice location, and very close the forest easy access for the hike. 
We did the hike with the hotel. It was a nice experience and saw many animals. The rooms don’t have sound proof. "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 5.0 ,"The location was the only positive thing. It's situated right next to the sinharaja forest entrance. Superior 5 bedded room was a normal triple room with 2 additional beds pushed in. Cost was double, size was the same. No mosquito nets unlike other rooms. No electric kettle as they said it got burnt by the previous client. So no tea making facilities. This bed room which was in between 2 other rooms was 80 US dollars where as a separate cabana room with more space was 32.5 dollars. With 5 beds there was hardly any space. Meals were expensive but quite average. Not tasty at all. No choice for breakfast when our requirements were told. They virtually gave the same menu on both days. Within the hotel there wasn't much to do except for a small pool. Amendments made in booking.com wasn't acknowledged so I had to argue with the hotel management. They said that the booking.com update wasn't received by them. I showed my email received through booking.com to them to finally convince them. This might be an issue for tourists who book through web. As they said that they should have been informed through phone other than for what was done through booking.com!"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 6.2 ,"The Staff was welcoming and helpful.  For the Breakfast we got ""String hoppers"" + ""Egg"" + ""Samboll"" + ""Potato curry"". That was tasty and we can't expect more for the price :). Overall the food is nice. Bathrooms wasn't clean :("
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,Located in clean and beautiful environment.  Helpful staff. Overall a good place to lodge .
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,Clean environment. Nice location. Bed is comfert. Hot water available. Food is delicious. Specially black spicy pork curry. Curd and treacle is superb. Staff crew is very friendly. If you wanna advencher experience you must entering Neluwa Lankagama side. And need a off-road bike.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 5.4 ,"I had a thought of having  the experience of staying in a hotel very close to Sinaharaja rain forest. If hotel system was off line your system could have been rejected my booking request. I booked 5 rooms from the property(Confirmation no is 2671.807.898) and when I called to get some information they said due to internet issue of them, my booking has not come to them. So they said they have taken a another booking and they were unable to accommodate my booking and suggested a separate location owned by them having said that property is much better than I booked,I guess for which they don't get much bookings due to its location. Although their staff is very good I think their management is doing some kind of cheating/misleading to us. Is  there any possibility of happening such sort of booking issue through your system. You have to have a serious look for this type of mal practices and stopping the travelers get caught to this type of hotels."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"On the doorstep of the rainforest! The room was really clean, and the food offered in the restaurant was delicious! The staff were really helpful & even called our next accommodation to help us plan transport. The hotel arranged a fantastic 7 hour trek with a guide into the rainforest which was 6000 rupees each (£28), but well worth it!  You have to get a tuk-tuk (ours cost 1200 rupees) or taxi to the resort - it was a bit of uncomfortable ~1 hour ride from Deniyaya as the roads are not the best (uneven paths / cobbles), however, don’t let this put you off, we had a fantastic time here! "

sinharaja-forest-gate, 5.4 ,"Hotel supplied a free ride after check out. Food was expensive. The locals were treated in a bad way. We got a very bad breakfast, but foreigners got a good meal. In addition, we followed google map navigation and the path was wrong. We ended up with a damaged car due to the terrible roads. Hotel didn't inform us about that earlier although they knew it. In addition, we had to hire a three Wheeler to reach the hotel which costs 350 rupees."

sinharaja-forest-gate, 3.8 ,"Transportation to the hotel is terrible. There is no protection for the room balcony and we had to be very careful with out kids.. There is no table in the room and it is very difficult, mainly to work with a laptop. No TV in entire hotel to watch overseas/sport channel. Very limited lunch & dinner menu options, specially for someone with sugar or cholesterol. Most of the staff was not friendly and cooperative."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"Great cottages.
Did professional guided tour with knowledgeable guide.(Pali who is the first and best guide who start the rain forest tours).Fantastic location to stay  3-4 nights with best view.

Definitely come back again.
Highly recommend accommodation, forest tour, explanation, cooking lesson and traditional foods. Best service ever"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 5.0 ,"Staff. They were exceptional in their service. Specially Ruwan and chaminda. Also the food was good (value for money).  The rooms were not upto standards and not clean.

sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"The location is just perfect. The entrance to the national park is just 5 minutes away. There are many walks that you can do. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The pick up is special but we really liked it. Make sure you have proper shoes on. The drive is nothing for old people. 😁Showers are warm during the day. So make sure you use them before sunset. Be careful in the pool. There is some sort of step that you can't see so that you're sliding down. Especially with kids. Make sure to close the pre door so that the dogs can't sleep there. We had two sleeping there. They growled the whole night as you are close to the forest with many animals inside. Normally I won't wake up but that was very scary. There was alert o someone knocking on our door at 4pm. So glad we locked it."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"This is a best place in Sri Lanka. just 2 minutes walking distance to sinharaja forest entrance. huge and lovely wooden Cottages facing to the rain forest, mountain and swimming pool. always hearing sounds of the waterfall (inside the forest)
They are best and experienced forest tour organizer in entrance of the forest. they're working with fantastic guides who expert about birds, reptiles, amphibians, flora and funa etc..
If you visit only for the forest Trekking, definitely they will pick up you from nearest village (last 2 km) also provide nice rooms for change.
Every day they organize beautiful village tour for everyone.(great..no words to describe about it)
Staff, restaurant, night trail, wifi also brilliant 👌👌👌
Great value for money.
If you visit Deniyaya, go and stay here
1000% highly recommend.

sinharaja-forest-gate, 3.8 ,"They asked to cancel the booking, but when I call and argue with them they agreed to give us the family room. The day we visited more than 20 people of a group were thereby drinking and singing. But the hotel staff said they will stop it after 10 pm. But they didn't and very loud till midnight. Vomiting and peeing everywhere, using the swimming pool always, Ultimately for the security reasons my family has to stay inside the room always. There are no standards when booking, they allowing bunch of people to come."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 2.5 ,"Its staff misled us.  The arrival of the hotel we had booked for the same reason.  Trying to stop it.  This is because they suddenly change their hotel prices.  Very low staff.  Although we paid and booked our rooms, they treated us like beggars.  A very fraudulent hotel.  I'm not giving anyone a positive comment about this hotel.  Fraudulent people who carry on small business with lies😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"The staff couldn't have more friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and the tour organised for us by the hotel was excellent too. It couldn't have been a better location literally being the last hotel on the forest entrance. Only thing to be aware of is if you are driving there yourself the road is quite tricky, however, the staff from the hotel came to help us get our vehicle down the road and safely to the car park."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"Place is next to the rainforest. It is great place to relax and chill. When I was there sun was shining and there was only few other people. Two days I could chill in pool totally alone and listen the sound of the rainforest. Every room has nice balcony next to rainforest and that is perfect spot for relaxing and meditation. The tour that I took was really nice and we could see many animals from the nature and swim in waterfalls. I would definitely visit here again! I had little bit cigar smoke in my room, when personal was smoking downstairs. That was stopped when I told about it. Otherwise no complains."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 10 ,"This was new experience, sleeping in a rainforest was a big thing for all my group.

Even the food portion is ok the rice felt like bit more salty3. Faced few power failures too4. Room facilities should be updated since we didn't saw many of those mentioned in the description5.

The hotel is in the forest, just 2 min from the entrance, so some bugs in the room are normal. The price for room is very good. The tour that hotel offers is very expensive, it’s completely overpriced. 6000 rupees for person (5h30, no need for a pick up because the hotel is in the entrance, some salt in your shoes for leeches and the guide that I didn’t understand well the “English” and a lunch (good!!)) This price doesn’t make any sense since the oficial ticket is 600 rupees per person and oficial guide that you can ask in the entrance park is 1000 rupees.
Ask the hotel before you get there, they have a pickup service from Pallegama I think. Tuk-tuK from Deniyaya is 1000 rupees. "

Right next to the forest entrance. On my second night a big group of locals arrived and had a big party. They started playing lound music at 7pm, and when i got up the next morning it was still going at 7am. I could even hear it through my earplugs. The staff appologized in the morning, but I think they could have made the effort to ask them to respect the fact there were other guests staying there. and turn off the music during the night.  There is hardly any internet coverage, but I think they were having it properly installed soon.The guide to take me into the forest arrived over an hour late - although I understood he worked externally to the hostel."

Their food was nice too.  The location was perfect as it is 5 minutes from the ticket office to Sinharaja Forest but you can't reach the hotel by car. You have to get there by tut or call the hotel to pick you up which is hard when there is no mobile network. This needs to be put on the description on Booking.com. 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Very kind host/owner. Good service. The pool and the view at the pool were absolutely amazing. Also the cabana’s were lovely with a very nice view, and very clean. Great location (a few seconds walk from the rainforest). You can walk around and meet the lovely locals or go hiking trough the rainforest, with a guide.  The taxi arranged by the owner was way too expensive. "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.5 ,"It was only around 10m to the Sinharaja Forest Reserve’s entrance. The food, staff and views were amazing. The road up to the hotel’s car park is full of potholes and is not suitable for cars, but a cab or jeep can make the trip.
There is no mobile signal to the hotel, so would appreciate if they provide WiFi even at a small cost.
The ride from the car park to the hotel is like a scene from a Stephen King thriller."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Friendly staff , atmosphere is calm and a cozy place..
It really close to sinharaja forest entrance.
Delicious food for affordable price. Specially srilankan rice & curry menu.
Gave us great guide (Danushka) to tour rainforest and we get marvellous experience . Danushka shared lot of information.
 Rs.7000 Charged (3500 per head) to visit 2 waterfalls on 5 hour rainforest tour. We believe  that amount is too much expensive. Otherwise everything is OK. We had great experience and love it. "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.8 ,Very friendly staff. They will try the best to meet the extra needs of the guest.  They have to find a way to keep the stray dogs out of the property. 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.8 ,Location to the rain forest. Staff were fantastic  No hot water in the bungalow. 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.5 ,Great hospitality Everything was good
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.1 ,"Beautifull place, friendly hosts, great breakfast, comfortable beds and bathroom The cabins are located right next to the rainforest which iz special but it is also very remote. You have to walk the last 400 meters or so and there is no phone or internet connection"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,"Very helpful and friendly staffsNice location Delicious food in a reasonable price The path that leads to the hotel is terrible(last 2 km)No internet access"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.1 ,Team was really helpful and friendly. They went out of the way to keep us comfortable in some situations. food were delicious . Thank you team for all the support Morning tea wasn't available at our convenient. Though food were taste enough had only limited options to select. Most unpleasant experience was we were disturbed by another group were in the property. It was an unpleasant experience we had during our stay
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"It is just next to Sinharaja forest entrance, in the wild forest. The infinity pool is great as well. They also helped us a to find a guide and were really nice to us The way to arrive is really difficult but they picked us up with a 4x4 truck in a bus station nearby"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,Breakfast only two varieties 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.8 ,"Very comfortable and fun stay. Was so easy to get to the rainforest, the tour was great especially the waterfall"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.8 ,"Lovely clean cabin with really comfortable bed, nice pool outside and friendly staff. The location is perfect; amazing views! Breakfast was great. We did a 5 hour tour with an enthousiastic and nice guide (saman). He had a lot of knowledge about the rainforest and explained everything well. Swimming in the waterfall was great! Lunch and dinner was good but a bit pricey. You also had limited choice (except for the hotels there are no restaurants close by so you are dependant on them) but for one of two nights I guess its fine. The tour was also overpriced (6000 per person)."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,"It's right at the gate of Sinharaja forest reserve and had a nice swimming pool. We had a trekking tour in the forest organized by the guesthouse. Our eagle guide named Saman constantly scanned the environment on search of some features of flora and fauna to wow the foreign guests. No hot water. No internet connection, and phone is out of signal."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.0 ,no phone signal at the property which Hotel should notified guests in advance. you can reach the property which high road clearance vehicle with max width of 1800mm.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 6.7 ,"The property is right at the entrance to one of the rainforest gates/entrances. The view is beautiful and the staff were helpful You can’t enter the rainforest without a guide, which we were hoping to do. It was an extra 4500LKR per person added onto your stay that they don’t tell you about in advance. 
There was so reception to research other options, and they have no wifi. 
They are not flexible with timing so we ate when they were ready to give us our food.
Lastly, when you are getting to the accomodation, it is really hard to find and a driver needs to come and get you in the 4WD because normal cars cannot use the road. Luckily our diver contacted them because we were not warned of this by the accomodation.. 
When we left we organised a driver with them and he did not speak English and we got lost for an extra 3 hours... so ensure you have addresses and access to maps to get you to your next stay "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,The location is absolutely stunning! Amazing pool overlooking the rainforest and the view from the cabins is just breathtaking. It’s very remote and our girls loved the bumpy 4x4 ride up to the property! We found the food delicious and the staff extremely welcoming and helpful. The manager organised a 4 hour walking tour for us which we thoroughly enjoyed and the leeches weren’t a problem! Gorgeous waterfall and unmissable views. Heaven on earth Bathroom didn’t smell good but we’ve experienced similar elsewhere in remote locations such as this. If this could be addressed then it would make the place perfect for us. Rooms are basic but comfortable and it’s fantastic value for money 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"The staff were really helpful and arranged everything during our stay, the location is perfect! You’re practically in the forest."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,Service with a smile. Staff very helpful. Good location lovely set-up. Enjoyed our stay. Toilet/bathroom could have been a bit more clean.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,"It is a very good place to stay  those who want to visit Sinharaja Forest. Staff is very friendly. It is on nice location. If you want to sing, it is also possible but you should not disturb other guests. There is a small swimming fool for just to relax in water. You do not have mobile signals around the area, so no disturbances from mobile phones."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,"The location and the arrangement is good..But the food  and the verities of the foods provided are less.since there is no place to buy foods nearby the hotel should be able to arrange verities of foods. Since the hotel is newly constructing the hotel team has used imported plants for the gardening(will be affect to the natural endemic plants and the will be spread all along the sinharaja forest).hence the hotel management team shall use only the natural endemic plants which will not destroy the surrounding valuable environment system."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.1 ,MEALS WAS EXCELLENT. STAFF WERE VERY HELPFUL AND COURTEOUS. BATHROOM WASH BASIN WAS STAINED AND NEEDED CLEANING. OUTSIDE BALCONY OF COTTAGES WAS TOO SMALL FOR FAMILY ROOM. BATHROOM NEEDS ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. WATER LEAKED FROM THE BATHROOM INTO SLEEPING AREA.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.5 ,good place natural view near the forest tasty food kind and fast staff roads are not good
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.5 ,"Location, staff, food No AC in room No hot water in bathroom Price of food is higher"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Very nice and quiet place with beautiful view at forest edge and entrance.

Very nice host helping with everything Taxi from Galle quite expensive"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.1 ,"with a nice view ,  very close to the sinharaja forest and friendly staff"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Comfy beds.., clean roomSrilankan dinner Price of tour package"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,This place is amazing :) Totally worth the way to get there!!! Be careful which route you choose if you drive on your own!!!! Take the longer one or make shure you ask via Mail before you get there best :)
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,"Great guide. Found all the target animals I wanted to photograph.Food was quite good and the pool was great to taking a dip when hot out. It was clean too. Need signs on road. Took a long time to find the lodge."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,The location is really nice during dusk and the morning. The staff are really helpful. The Sri Lankan food prepared were excellent.  I would call this a location for Glamping. The staff were really helpful. The local food was excellent. The guide to the forest was good as well. As there is no mobile phone connectivity and WiFi it is a bit secluded. If you want that kind of experience it is perfect. Also if they get hot water it would be a great location to visit.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,"Loved my stay here.  Lodges were new and clean, and eco-friendly.  Service was excellent, with very helpful staff.  Food was good.  Excellent location near the entrance to Sinharaja Forest. Bit difficult to get to which I think is an issue for the Sinharaja Forest in general."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"+ Great location to visit Sinharaja Rainforest 
+ Cosy cabanas 
+ Friendly staffs
+ Cable TV inside the room
+ There’s a small swimming pool within the compound, but we did not utilize it
+ Great value for money, where room rate included simple breakfast and free transfer from carpark to the cabanas 
 - inside cabana gets really warm in the afternoon even with the fan on
- no warm water for people who are afraid of cold shower at night. But okay for us as it gets really warm in the afternoon and hence great to have cold shower "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.8 ,"Foods are very good and adequate. friendly staff did excellent job. The guide who took us to forest charge 2500 .I think this is too much for local guest . There was function for some group of people from a some company while our stay , it disturb for our sleep and calm environment."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Location is about 50m to the Sinharaja entrance..Staff was friendly and supportive, assisted by arranging forest visits etc.Food was decent and the way they preparing meals and serving was hygienic..In generally Services received during the stay was excellent.Accommodation also was comfortable. Further as it is located adjacent to the forest, felt the difference when comparing with similar facilities around the area."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,Because it is isolated a 4-wheel drive is needed to travel the 3-4 kilometre distance from a pick-up point. The driver was not considerate of the person sitting in the back of the truck (me) who was thrown around when going over all the bumps. I commented on this to him at the end of the journey and he said that he was going slowly. My husband who was sitting in the cab with the driver asked him to slow down and he just laughed. The driver was inconsiderate of guests comfort and not open to suggestion. I would not recommend this hotel for the driver’s offensiveness alone
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Friendly staff
Quick service 
Location 
Cleanliness  Better to have hot water facility "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,Awesome place.staff is great.food was delious
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.1 ,Hotel is near the sinharaja entrance. Its just few minutes walk to the entrance. The food was great. We booked a double room. But we were given a triple room. Also there was a problem with electricity due to heavy rains. The generator was so loud and it was right under our room. If not for the electricity issue I think i stay would have been a better one.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Lovely landscape, friendly staff and nice swimming piol. Great place to start an adventure trip to Sinharaja rain forest. Because the place is optimal for rain forest trip, there is not much other activities in the evenings. For us it was ok, but it is good to be prepared."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,This place has a lot of potential. The location is right next to the National Forest entrance. The swimming pool is a fantastic way to cool down. Waking to the sound of the rainforest is amazing. The rooms are pretty cute and the views are breathtaking. The breakfast is hearty and tasty. The staff is really friendly and tries to be as helpful as possible. They are very new and still working out some of the bugs. Right now the area doesn't have any cell service making it difficult for communication with the hotel but a new tower is being built and should be working in a couple of months. This will make it a lot easier to get to the hotel. Our driver had a hard time getting in touch with the hotel to get directions once we got to the area. Some of the roads are only accessible by 4 wheel drive so you have to park at a parking lot and then the hotel drives you the rest of the way so being able to reach the hotel is imperative.  They do not have a lot of rooms so keep in mind that the category of room that you book is a request not a guarantee.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.1 ,People are very friendly.. Road conditions to enter the location poor.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,"Wonderful view of the jungle, nice relaxing swiming pool.Trekking starts from there, because location is already in the jungle.Trekking guide very professional. Prices for trekking little bit high, but it really worth anyway."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,"Very comfortable, especially given the location so close to the rainforest reserve entrance. The pool was amazing. Good food, if a little on the spicy side. Free pickup from and drop-off at the parking that is reachable by car. Friendly and helpful staff. Had to leave water running forever until warm water appeared. No separation of showers from rest of bathroom: showering got the entire bathroom floor wet. Rainforest tour organised by the hotel was good (great guide) but pricey (6000 Rs per person for a slightly extended version of the standard two-waterfalls route)."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,The staff was excellent and treated my family better than I expected. The concept of the property is simple but adorable.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,"Nature around the accommodationInfinity poolDinner Room had square opening for windows which were not covered with net to prevent bugs from entering.Therefore the room during the night was full of bugs, flies, no-see-um, crickets and fireflies..."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,The hotel is close to the forest entrance and very comfortable. The pool is small but it is still nice to have a swim. There is a lot for breakfast.  The rooms had a bad smell and although I left the windows open all the time I could not get rid of it. The bathroom was even worse. It smelled as if somebody smoked over there. There was not so much space in the room but luckily I was the only one over there - so I could handle it very well. The restaurant is pricey. The staff was barely even able to speak English and to answer my questions.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,An exellent place.  Difficult way to reach the place
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"Location  We need to take 1.5 km transport to hotel from the parking place. The broken bridge not at all safe. Also another tiny concrete slab is broken. Very dangerous
"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,The staff is very friendly and they have given the better service. Foods are delicious. They have prepared  foods for children under 8 months There were dogs in the restaurant premises that does not belong to them.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.5 ,"Food very tasty and flexible Service not yet professional, need training "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"I liked almost everything, Place is little far from where you can reach trough a vehicle, but they do have the parking then they have their shuttle that's nice, place is just near at the Sinharaja entrance, Staff is super friendly and they have their own restaurant I liked the food their smoothies and cool drinks ++++, Location is super nice, will visit again with my family. Water pressure and the faucets"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.0 ,"Very pleasant accommodation (they really didn´t save with mahogany  :-)), you will be a party of the green flora. The good breakfast on the terrace and huge portion of the dinner emphasize all."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,"Location Swimming pool need to be functionable all the time, except cleaning day "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,The view was excellent and the bed was comfortable. There was no hanger in the bathroom to hang the towel or any clothes. It is better to have a table in the room.
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,Staff is very friendly and helpful  Housekeeping is not that good 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,"Directly at the forest with the noise of the jungle. 
Nice pool.
Friendly staff.
Plenty good breakfast and diner.
Organized our most sympathic jungle guide Prabath. He lead us also up to Lions Rock.
 Leeches! That’s not in the responsibility of the hotel in fact, but prepare for it."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.3 ,"Staff is really friendly and food is tasty. Rooms are average. We had to park our cars and go in their trucks to the location where the ride is not at all comfortable. However, the location is convenient to enter into Sinharaja forest. You may not find proper signal to your mobile phone however, you may survive with wifi. Overall I am satisfied and recommend to everyone who are on budget option."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,"The location was great, only a few meters from the entrance of the rainforest.
There were lots of options for rainforest exploring with a trained guide, we took the day tour up to Lion Rock, what an experience! The only thing that was missing was a comfortable lounge chair, to sit in when you return from a rainforest hike."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,Location was so Amazing ..Morning climate were awesome
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,"Great Staff 🔥Tasty food 🥘 Food choices should  be improved"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.6 ,"nice place, good pool, children like it very much. Close to the park, nice tour inside the park, monkeys (not regular macacas, but  special park species)come close to the site to eat leaves from trees. slow work of the personal inside, but thats because many of them don""t speak english so they go to the main chief to ask what we want from them and so on."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,"*everyone was smiling and welcoming
*In the middle of nature
*Superb tasting Sri Lankan home made meals - hot and fresh
 * No credit card acceptance
* Promised $5 lunch and dinner not available
* Miscalculated bill when corrected, office staff was aggressive and had not a nice attitude
* City people bring city noise (loud boom boxes) and there are no rules against noise except after 10pm"
sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.0 ,"The location was great as it is only 100m away from the Sinharaja entrance. The swimming pool was good for relaxation. The staff were very friendly and attended to our requests quickly. The lunch and dinner food was delicious. Breakfast was good although lacking in variety. Overall, we got good value for money. The bathroom was not clean when we arrived, as the floor was watery and the drainage was not good. The commode seat caused a rash indicating that it wasn't sanitised properly. While cabana style is good, they get very hot during the daytime, as the ventilation wasn't great. The facility had a lingering smell during the stay."

sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.9 ,"The foods were good, the palce is nice and the staff were very kind. It is good that they have a swimming pool. Otherwise the area is really nice and diverse, it is worth to visit.  Compared to the nothern part of Sinharaja or the other parts of Sri Lanka, the tours we booked were expensive, especially if we consider that we barely saw what we wanted. The guide was not well prepared, misidentified many species. Maybe it is enough for simple tourists but not for birdwatchers. "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.0 ,Perfect location for the park hiking. 
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.0 ,"The hut was clean and comfortable. Location is greate. The food was very tasty. We've ordered and payed for the hut with mountain view (it was a little bit more than ""standard"" hut) but were no huts with mountain view! So we payed more and got standard hut. Another thing is, that when they were trying to convince us to take theirs guide to Sinharaja forest for 6500 rupees, they said, thad we can leave our luggage in the room until we come back and take a rest. But we decided that we will take another, cheaper guide and then they told us to take our luggage in the morning.The water in the pool was not so clean."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.0 ,"Amazing pool with view. You dont have to take a forest tour to see all animals because they visit hotel all the time :).  My double room had one extra single bed, which took a lot of space. "
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.8 ,"Super close (less than 100m) to the gate of the Sinharaja Rainforest. Beds were comfortable. Pool was refreshing and clean. Restaurant was good with reasonable pricing. Staff were accommodating asking us when we’d like to eat, etc.  There isn’t much else around the accommodation, aside from the rainforest. Mosquito nets would’ve been helpful for a peace of mind. Bathrooms needed a bit of extra love (a bit smelly and lots of ants all over the place). Staff were hoping for us to use their own guides, but we found a guide at the gate for 1/3 of the price. "

sinharaja-forest-gate, 7.0 ,Location is good food is a bad
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.0 ,"It is a great value for the money. A friend & I stayed in the dorm room and had it all to ourselves. If there were 5 people, it would have been very tight. Breakfast was nice and the food at lunch/dinner was good. 1-2 nights is plenty here, as it is far up the road by the entrance and there's not much else to do. Transport up the road was 500 rps & I feel it should be included in the price. Cabins are very basic, but fine for the price. They are pushy to get you to use one of their guides. Ours wasn't great, but we also chose the cheapest option. The all-inclusive tours are quite expensive."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.0 ,"The location is perfect, just next to the rain forest park entrance. Room was clean and big. Hot water in the shower. Nice, clean swimming pool, where you can chill out after trekking. Real ""in the middle of the jungle"" experience, monkeys coming next to the cottage, a lot of birds and sounds of the forest.  They organize a free pick up from the village, couse there is no option to get to the hotel with your car. Staff speaks English very poorly. One of them broke the wheel from our suitcaise and didn't even say sorry."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.2 ,"We spent a night in Sinharajah Forest Gate and were delighted. On the one hand it was wonderful to be in such a beautiful surrounding nature and on the other hand we were delighted with the accommodation. It was spacious and clean everything was wonderful.
The food in the accommodation was fantastic, everybody was very friendly and tried to please all guests. We highly recommend the accommodation! The only drawback was the mosquito net, it was too small for the big bed. :-)"

sinharaja-forest-gate, 9.0 ,"On of the greatest values for the money spent. The location was great. Rooms were clean. Nothing much to complain about. Options for meals are a bit limited. However, the meals served were good and tasty. Stay wouldn't be elderly friendly as the road to reach the stay is a bit of an off road trip where the transport is provided free or charge. Card payments were not accepted."
sinharaja-forest-gate, 8.0 ,Scenic beauty and the environment is exquisite. Quality and Quantity of the food was superb. especially the hospitality of  caretaker Mr. Ruwan was great. inadequate facilities to arrange BBQ  for more than one group at a time.  Had only one BBQ machine.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 6.7 ,"The room was decent - they can improve a lot Before placing the reservation I called and checked if the hotel had a drivers quarters to stay. They informed me I had to pay an additional Rs. 1500 which includes breakfast and a place for the driver to stay. To my surprise the next day when we checked out my driver informed me that he slept in the vehicle. I was in shock because we don’t treat our employees like this. He had no food also. They even sent me an email saying they have an place for the driver to stay. If not we wouldn’t have booked this place  Check in: I called 20 minutes prior to the arrival and i informed the receptionist that I am coming if they can keep the rooms ready and I cannot wait long as I was in a hurry to to a wedding. Check in took 20 minutes. They took their cool time. Also they wanted all 3 IDs which is never the case in Colombo hotels and they took ages to give the balance payment. It wasn’t a pleasant check in specially when I had informed prior that I need to check in immediately and I have no time. The room was nice but the glasses in the room wasn’t washed properly. The extra bed did not have a blanket. The TV did not work. Morning breakfast was a huge let down. The juice was horrible. The food was almost half burnt and we had no choice but to eat what they prepared and there was no one to even serve water. We had to go look for a staff member to ask for water. Place was decent but they really need to improve in service. Hospitality is nill."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.1 ,"The hotel was very nice and modern. It was well situated and very clean. We did not find the staff were very informed about the area. They could improve on certain areas like being able to give change for larger notes, knowing where the nearest postbox was, etc. The breakfast buffet was terrible on our first morning but improved on the next two days. The beach access could also be kept nicer and look more attractive. Overall it’s a nice hotel but not operating at its stated standard."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.5 ,"The hotel looks amazing, its very clean, receptionist was very friendly and helpful, pool area is nice and relaxing, rooms are very spacious and AC and TV works great. We ordered club sandwich for dinner and was very tasty and good portion.  The restaurant stuff didnt inform us about what breakfast would be. When it came, full English breakfast and toasts were cold, they forgot to bring coffee and it came after we had finish eating, this happened 2 days in a row. When you ask for something, the stuff dont know much about it or don’t understand English, which is challenging to get what you asked for. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Everything. Rooms were spacious and very comfortable. We’d recommend the sea view. Breakfast was fantastic. Staff were kind, obliging and friendly.
Would thoroughly recommend staying here for a relaxing treat. Nothing"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"LOCATION: This hotel is located on a spectacular stretch of beach-one of the prettiest,imo,in all of Sri Lanka- and definitely the best area to stay in Tagalle.(Avoid dilapidated  Tangalle  Bay)  Many  small restaurants,cafes, and small hotels line this beach-yet the area is very quiet,with practically no road traffic. Many young people stay in this area. The view of the beach from the  hotel pool is mesmerizing! HOTEL: The hotel is absolutely gorgeous! The architect/designers obviously took great care to construct a visually stunning  boutique hotel -one that would warrant 5-stars were it in Miami Beach or Dubai. The rooms are huge,with high ceilings and top-of -the line finishes,designer lighting,and high -end bathrooms. Luxurious beds,pillows and linens.SERVICE: The ample staff was gracious and humble,and the manager and front desk made great efforts to accomodate any special needs.FOOD: A small hotel (I think 20 or so rooms) obviously can not offer the variety of a 300-room hotel,but there were so many nearby restaurants that it was not a problem.CONCLUSION: I almost stayed in the Anatara,but it’s isolated,and requires a tuk-tuk to go anywhere; whereas Golden Pearl is quiet but exposes one to the friendly local culture . I stayed 4 nights and wish it had been a week or more.I slept better here than at any of the 5 other Sri Lanka hotels I stayed in over the course of a month."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Position, really new hotel, nice staff Way to the beach is unorganized."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"The best hotel in town! Minimalistic design, lovely swimming pool and garden. Nice place to stay, enjoy the ocean and rest. Upgrading for the ocean view from balcony worth any money!Very friendly and kind people."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Very comfy rooms and beds. The staff were always very friendly and polite.The pool was lovely and always kept very clean. Hotel grounds were nice. Breakfast was nice but could use some hot-plates so that the hot food remained hot, (cold beans are never good!)I also think the hotel should have enough sun-loungers for each person at the hotel so you don't have to worry about not getting one. I think there were only 10 in total."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,lovely staff; big room; beautiful design - tourists walking by were stopping to take pics; hotel wasn't finished when I stayed but it was clear that it would be a great property when finished.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 6.0 ,Quite ok. Nice location Not value for money.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 5.0 ,On booking the room has a private pool and on arrival did not exist... 
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.0 ,"Fantastic location on the beach. Excellent bedroom sizes & facilities. Great swimming pool. Good value for money, despite staff challenges. Some of the staff didn't seem to know what they should be doing, others were excellent. No point having a bar without a reasonable range of alcoholic drinks & someone trained to run it."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 6.2 ,"Very clean room, comfortable bed, good place to stay if these are your priorities as rest was below par.  They stuffed up our booking so check-in took a while then they also asked us to switch room half way through our 2 night stay. Breakfast had artificial condensed juices rather than fresh juices which was odd. Front desk staff didn’t speak English (which in itself is fine) but they sort of pretended they did so we just ended up with error after error and incorrect information etc. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Everything was great and the staff were 💯
Angelee(not sure on the spelling) even made me a book mark when she saw I was using a twig.  If I had to pick faults, two minor issues were the slight lack of sun beds although we were happy to lie on the beach and got one most days, the hot water was also limited and ran out fairly quickly. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Everything was perfect!!
Nice staff, beautiful and modern hotel, good breakfast, big and clean room!!
"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Brilliant room, lovely location, beautiful building. Loved it "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,Everything Nothing
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"This was an excellent hotel all round. Location is great, at one end of the street. You can walk up the road along the beach past loads of restaurants and places to eat. The hotel itself was great, very clean, spacious rooms and the staff were friendly. There’s a bar either side of the hotel you can get coconuts and beers at and bring them back to the hotels pool area. The grass by the pool was really nice to sit on and relax. Wifi was excellent too! The breakfast wasn’t a hot buffet breakfast, for example the bacon/tomatoes/hash browns were cooked in the kitchen, put on a plate and brought to the breakfast area, so if you didn’t get it as soon as it was put out on the table it was cold. Although you could order your eggs which came directly from the kitchen."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Perfect location, nice beach, very comfortable bed, nice room with amazing view, good breakfast."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"+ Nicely located on a quite place of the beach.+ Big, well appointed and comfy rooms.+ Nice swimming pool.+ Fishermens are having the nets close to the beach nearby the hotel so you get to see the local life and the catch. We've seen a big turtle once! It was released in the water.+ Great Thai Green Curry in the restaurant and the hot croissants at the breakfast!All in all we had a great stay that we extended with 1 more night even if the asked price for the extra night was 90% higher than the one that we initially booked. (this quote was not quite nice from the hotel but we took it as it was still a decent price) - Staff is sometimes not attentive. When they are serving you in restaurant they are disappearing so you have to wait a little too much. Also, the check-in did not present the facilities too well.- The breakfast is not 4 stars. It is not varied, they do not have hot plates to keep the food hot, they serve soluble coffee and they do not provide juice machines as you see in all 4 stars hotels."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,The croissants were amazing.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"It was really nice hotel, the architecture of the hotel is beautiful. We also enjoyed the pool and appreciated the location on the beach. The bathroom could be cleaner, we have cockroaches in the bathroom."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"I loved everything about the place. Very courteous, friendly and helpful staff. The best place on the beach to stay. Most importantly the food was excellent and quite big portions. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Quite new and modern hotel, bedrooms were very large and clean. Great sea view from the balcony. Lovely pool which then went straight onto the beach.  Rooms didn’t get cleaned until almost 5pm which after a day in the sun we had already returned by then so would be nice to be done earlier. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Very comfortable western style hotel. Huge room, very comfortable bed and clean bathroom.Good location near restaurants.Beautiful beach and a gorgeous little bar on the beachfront. You can take drinks from there into the pool area. A bit soul-less. Worst breakfast I had in Sri Lanka. Terrible buffet, stale attempt at western style food. Instant coffee. No attention from staff.A bit overpriced compared to other places I stayed in Sri Lanka which had amazing breakfasts."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"This is an outstanding hotel - true luxury and amazing little touches like a rain shower and usb plugs by the bed. Felt like a 10 star experience with the stunning decor and gated entrance! Breathtaking view from the balcony overlooking the pool, beach and sea - one of the best sunrises I have seen. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Spotlessly clean. Fabulous breakfast buffet and the tastiest vegetable omelette I've ever had! Great location, seconds away from great bars and restaurants.  The pool looked quite murky and green, like it was full of algae - they assured us it was properly maintained but it put me off swimming in it. It didn't matter though because the beautiful warm sea was right there in front of me!
One other teeny tiny thing - most places we have stayed at so far have welcomed us with fresh fruit juice and at Golden Pearl it tasted like squash, which seemed a bit at odds with the rest of the luxury feel. It was evening time so perhaps they had run out of fresh juice."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Everything, food amazing, very clean, the pool is wow.We loved it! It was a little noisy, because you can hear all the waves.And on the beach were a lot of fishermen."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Perfectly!
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"It is modern hotel located at the see.  Rooms were cleaned very late, usually at 4-6 o’clock in the evening."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Beautiful room overlooking beach.  Staff were attentive.  Great location.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Perfect location right on the beach. Good breakfast. Very good cocktails in the bar. Clean and big room. Windows in bathroom was dirty. But we kept it closed anyway.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Amazing location, friendly staff, delicious food, and nice pool and beach. Sea view rooms were beautiful!!  Restaurant situation was a little unclear, it’s not well marked or obvious that it’s open and there’s not much ambiance (no background music or anything). But the meals were incredible so it’s worth figuring out! "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"This is a brand new luxury hotel next to Tangalle Beach, with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, yet very peaceful. Only 10 minutes walk from the town centre. We paid a bit extra for a Super Deluxe Room with Sea View, and it was amazing. Massive room, extremely comfortable bed, silent air conditioning, beautiful bathroom and lovely balcony overlooking the beach. Breakfast was good, usual ""western"" fare, although the bacon and beans are served cold which was a bit odd. Eggs are provided if you ask. Some more Sri Lankan specialities would have made it more interesting. Outside there is a good sized pool and grassed area next to the beach with free sunbeds. Highly recommended. The wifi in our room (206) was variable, yet it was fine in the adjacent bedroom and in the public areas."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Big room great facilities helpful staff great location beautiful beach No lift and pool closed too early
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.3 ,"Chicken green curry from the restaurant was excellent, kind staff"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"The hotel is new and modern and located right on the beach. Our room was clean and spacious, and the bed was big and comfortable. Breakfast was tasty and varied. There were a few cozy bars around. In general, we enjoyed this place. The most annoying thing - the staff is trying to cheat you on exchange rates. We paid a bit more than it was on our booking. We've never seen such an attitude for our two trips to Sri Lanka. It's not a question of money but a question of relations to guests. As a result, our first impression was quite bad.Also, when we arrived, it was high tide. So the beach was quite dirty. But the staff even didn't bother to clean up plastic bottles from their hotel's side of the beach."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,A great location to enjoy the sea with a lovely pool to swim in too.  The room was very spacious and staff tried really hard to help resolve things. Better internet- although they tried to make it better for us. Free bottled water for a place of this standard.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Location, lovey staff. Pool loungers were filthy - but they were cleaned when pointed out."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Great location right on the beach. Bed was super comfy, bathroom was nice and big and clean. Ate dinner at the hotel which was tasty, but property is in great location to explore other restaurants too. Rooms on the ground floor are right off reception so you can hear everything"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Amazing location and a step away from the beach. It looks almost like the note has a private beach.  The English of the staff, specially on the restaurant is very limited. Sometimes it was very hard to try express ourselves "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"The pool was fantastic the first day we stayed then the next two days we were unable to the use the pool due to a chemical imbalance... The whole place was beautifully set out and the rooms were wonderful with amazing views ... the staff were fantastic especially the young girl on reception she was very very accommodating for our requests. Unfortunately we were not keen on the breakfast as it had no Sri Lanka options. They had way out hot breakfast options they would better off having just eggs bacon porridge fresh fruit yoghurt, noddles."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Staff was very nice and helpful, breakfast tasty and fait enough.  Location near the beach , with pool. Good interior design. We recommend ! Maybe the pool can be openend a bit later but noise can be a problem  for rooms with sea view"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"This is a completely new hotel, so the interior is super nice. The rooms are spacious, clean and have evrything you need. The staff is well trained and really helpful. Guests were mostly families and couples. We only stayed for one night, but it was probably the best night’s sleep we had in Sri Lanka."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Excellent location with the pool space opening up right onto the beach. Great beach views from balcony rooms. Very friendly staff and clean rooms. Plenty of local restaurants within walking distance A few minor fitout issues, toilet roll too far from the toilet, Tv quiet far from the bed and dim lighting in bathroom - nothing major, would still return!"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"What a gem! New hotel, right on the beach, big room, great views - loved it and it was great value! Staff great too and breakfast buffet yum. That we only stayed one night!"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"The breakfast was very good and different each morning, the staff helpful and the beach in front of the hotel was actually nice with the trees and the sunbeds. The room was very big and so was the balcony. We had a very nice stay there."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Nice clean rooms. Friendly staff, quick access to the beach. Little bit off from everything."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"This was one of our favourite hotels in Sri Lanka, the room was huge and modern. The bathroom and bedroom were beautiful decorated and clean. We had our own balcony and the bed was the most comfortable I’ve probably ever stayed in. The location is excellent and the pool/ garden area is lovely. We loved Tangalle !  The air con did not get very cold and it was a big room with lots of glass so it would take ages to cool down. The staff didn’t know how to make the cocktails on the menu, not their fault but management and I had to tell the server how to make a mojito. The food wasn’t great and I would not choose to eat there again. I didn’t enjoy the breakfast at all. They tried to charge 9,000 to go 2 hours to unawatuna we paid 5,000 elsewhere - I don’t think it is right to try and scam your own customers out of money when they are already spending a lot of money with you for room, food and drinks etc. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Best place during our trip in Sri Lanka! Beautiful hotel on magnificent beach with very customer minded personnel!
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"The staff were absolutely incredible! The food was great, and the facilities excellent. The hotel boasts a fantastic pool and you are about 20 steps from the gorgeous beach.The staff were always on hand if you needed anything. We wanted to arrange a trip to Yala National Park and the hotel manager arranged a private car to take us to the Park and onwards travel to our next destination in Ella.Our room was superb, with amazing views of the ocean from our (huge) balcony. We would 100% recommend this hotel- we plan to come back on our next visit to Sri Lanka! This is only a tiny thing and not a negative point really. The hotel and restaurant lacked ambience, especially noticeable in the evenings when you want to have dinner! It would help if there was music playing in the foyer and around the pool, perhaps! Only a tiny point to consider on what was otherwise a fantastic stay!"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,The staff was nice and helpful. The location for Tangalle and to know that area is really good. Near to lots of restaurants. Breakfast is also good. For a 4 star hotel it’s missing a lot. We asked for a good and traditional massage place and they had to go ask around. They should have a list of suggestions for guest. The fact that the swimming pool closes at 18:00. When you are the beach the staff is incapable of asking is you would like something or bring a menu.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.3 ,"The swimming pool is such a luxury in the heat and our 3 year old daughter loved it! Also the rooms were really spacious with a good bath, shower and comfy bed.  The property is new and still has some teething problems like leaks in the hallways. Nothing major though. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Stayed for just one night; for the price you pay, this property exceeds expectations. It is clean, food is decent (we only had breakfast), staff is friendly and the rooms were more than comfortable. Added bonus is the small pool and the beach at your doorstep. Thumbs up! The shower in our room (205) was broken and had a tendency to spray water directly at our faces. Not fun! However, as it was just one night, we did not make too much of an issue of it."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Very big room. Quiet zone. Nice view. Comfortable bed. Nice pool. The staff was very fast to our needs. Good breakfast. Everything was perfect.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,The decor and style of the hotel was very nice. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay here. -
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Wonderful hotel right on the beach! A small hotel, but had everything you could want. Staff were fabulous and very accommodating. It was a great place to just relax and enjoy Life  Due to it being the Low season, not all items on the menu were available. But what was there was very good we still had plenty of choice. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Very comfortable bed. Very nice and friendly  receptionist. Room facilities excellent. Worth for the money.Small cute hotel. Breakfast good not fantastic. Waiter not a flexible or friendly. He serving foods without any manner."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"It's a nice and modern hotel with a beachfront. The staff was nice, we enjoyed our stay there."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,The staff was amazing huge delicious breakfast and the best comfortable room with minibar tv you name it!
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Lovely place to stay.
Nice pool
The beach is great for a swim then relax on the grass behind the pool.
Nice home restaurants down the road and a few beach bars not far away.
Great place to stay. Have already recommended it to other travellers I've met along the way.
Was a bit surprised to find a place of this standard in Tangalle."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"The hotel is in an excellent location, right on the beach, close to restaurants and near the town. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious, bed was very comfortable and the rainfall shower was lovely. The hotel was very clean and there always seemed to be people around cleaning different areas. The pool was perfect to cool off and relax. Breakfast was nice, with lots of different options everyday. The restaurant was nice but we would have preferred more local food on the menu, it was also quite expensive compared to the other restaurants very near the hotel.We stayed during the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and were disappointed that the hotel staff didn't talk to us about it or let us know of the curfews. Another guest informed us of the incidents and we tried staying up to date on the internet but connection wasn't very good after the attacks. We tried to talk to one member of staff about it but he looked nervous and didn't say very much. We felt like they had been told not to talk about it. Fortunately, we didn't feel scared and our taxi driver kept us up to date with curfew times. A little reassurance and advice about the curfews would have been nice."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Fantastic hotel with a nice pool. Very good breakfast and very friendly staff. We can only regret we stayed for two days. Highly recommended. One of the best spots in Tangalle. And just ro mentiob - the design of the hotel is vey modern.  Everything was ok.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"The beach was just after the swimming pool area at the back of the hotel. It is a well equipped modern place. Breakfast was not particularly good, specially if you go continental. The only coffee option was instant coffee, and the only tea were some bags from a common English brand"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Room was very spacious and had everything you could need. Bathroom was large and featured a lovely shower. Staff was going to extra mile in making us feel welcomed. Would very much reccomend anyone staying here. Breakfast was not on par with the rest of the facilities.
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.8 ,"Staff was great, they give you towels at the pool, you have free use of the pool all day long and get direct access to the beach (where the sand is very good, and beside many good restaurants), got a kettle to make our green tea and a fridge to keep our water and drinks in, comfy and huge bed and pillows, clean bathroom, silent AC, and also a very complete breakfast. This is what made the difference and lowered the grade; there was a wedding reception at our hotel and on the morning of the reception we were woken up by techno disco music full blast!! The speakers had an extra sub-buffer cause we even felt some vibrations. Since this happened at 7am we were awoken way before we intended to start the day. Thoughtless from the staff's side! After half an hour they turned it off but the damage was done and we remained tired for the day ;("
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.9 ,"Really good location, right on the beach. Very calm and quiet, perfect for someone who wants to relax and just enjoy the beautiful beach. The food could be better. Try to go out and have food on the so many tasty restaurants around the city"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.9 ,"The location was great, straight off the beach and close to the bus station.
The room was big and spacious and the housekeeping staff were lovely. 
The lady on reception was really smiley and kind.  The breakfast was cold, even though it was meant to be a hot buffet. The executive chef tried to sell is a candlelit dinner on the beach, however whilst wanting to eat our breakfast in peace, this was a little annoying. 
 The water stopped working and no compensation was given. I told reception about the problem where there was a tiny trickle of water coming out of taps and shower, then 10 minutes later they came to see and by then there was nothing coming out of the tap. I was told the maintainence were on their way, and I waited and waited... Having been by the pool all day and wanting to shower before my evening meal , continued to wait... 
Eventually we had to go for a meal without a shower. On return we were told it was working, but in reality it was cold and there was only a trickle of water. The next morning at around 11am the water was back fully functioning. Upon checkout, I requested some compensation for the problem seeing as we spent a significant amount staying here, after the receptionist spoke to the manager they gave us a 10% discount off our laundry bill. This is a poor excuse as an apology given the inconvenience and I will be contacting management here accordingly. 
At times, we were woken early by staff talking very loudly as the echo around the hotel is significant. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Good location, rooms are lovely "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,Really lovely place with a nice spot on the beach and quite close to some good restaurants. Both the lunch we had there and the breakfast were delicious! 
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.3 ,"Staff was very friendly, nice pool, you can walk straight to the beach. When its raining the hallways get very wet and slippery."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Really enjoyed our stay here. The staff were very very friendly and helpful. The place had a lovely atmosphere at all times. We got to have a candle lit dinner by the pool on our last night without even asking which was a great touch. The beach is right outside the pool area so we could go between beach and pool at our leisure. The current was very strong and the waves were very rough so wouldn’t be a great swimming beach. The pool was amazing and warm but the only problem was loads little insects at the corner of the pool inside the water which another guest told me had bitten her and the bites were itchy, this was a massive turn off for the pool but I still went in and avoided these areas and didn’t get any bites. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.3 ,"Nice rooms and good decoration, super nice girl in to the reception The swimming pool was not available"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 7.9 ,"Staff are really kind and super helpful.Close to the city.Rooms are specious. Staff and the management did their best to accommodate all our requests. Beds are comfy. Great view from the balcony.  Just a step on the beach. Wifi did not pick up. Had to open the door to get a slightly better coverage. Sea was rough and only option to swim was the pool. Unfortunately the pool was not accessible due to the chemicals used on the previous day. Breakfast could have been betterNot value for money."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"The rooms were very well appointed and well maintained 
The breakfast was good and organized "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Room were spacious, modern and clean. Great swimming pool and loved the ocean access. Staff were helpful and courteous. Highly recommend staying here but not to eat. Beautiful restaurants around the area.  Overall the food wasnt great. 
Staff were helpful but Breakfast was average, and only eat there one night , This night don’t recommend the Candlenight dinner. Both the jumbo prawns and Chilli crab had minimum meat?? Lucky to have half a bite full of meat. Soup was great and dessert was good. 
Not sure of other dishes on menu as we eat elsewhere after that. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Beautiful rooms and the hotel looks luxurious. Comfortable beds. Its on the beach and is close to the city center. Also just a 10 min walk to the nr 1 restaurant in Trip Advisor ""Ceylon Excel"".  The breakfast was really not to brag about. The cereal was soft from staying out in an open bowl in the heat, the juice was not good."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Rooms were large and very clean 
Breakfast was delicious
Pool was excellent and loved being right next to the beach as well"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Nice new hotel right on beach. Staff couldn't do enough. Meal were good but not great. Room spacious, comfortable and view of ocean. Would recommend."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Everrything was great!  They have the cooking machines for omelettes in the same saloon where you eat. Then you smell as fried cooking!
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"The lovely view from the room, the very easy access to the beach and the pool."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"The room, the pool, the whole hotel is amazing, comfortable and a perfect spot for a bit of luxury on an lovely long quiet beach in a great spot on the coast.
 Unfortunately the food doesn’t match up to the rest of the hotel. It is overly expensive for what it is and for what else is out there in the surrounding area. The menu really just needs to be simplified and doesn’t need to be lots of Western options, we are in Sri Lanka for Sri Lankan food and culture, give it to us please! Even drinks prices are twice the price as everywhere else, there is no real reason for everything to be so expensive and if it wasn’t we would of ordered so much more instead of just going next door, as we really wanted to just stay by the pool but couldn’t justify the price when it’s cheaper elsewhere.
The breakfast is a very mixed bag, fresh eggs and omelettes which was lovely, but everything else is just kept warm in containers. Seems crazy to do half but not the rest. Also again a massive lack of Sri Lankan breakfast classics. 
You could really take advantage of being on the beach more too! I’ve only said so much as we loved our stay and would definitely like to comeback but it’s just so close to being a 10/10 with a few improvements."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Room and bathroom very big and spacious. The best quality-price hotel we have been in Sri Lanka
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 8.3 ,It was very nice. Big rooms  Next time we’ll book a room with a/c (not fan) because it was very hot and we couldn’t open the balcony because of the mosquitoes
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"Very nice, new hotel in a calm part of Tangalle (10 min walk from center), directly on the beautiful calm beach. Nice pool, garden, sun beds, great staff. Double room very spacious and clean. Great, helpful staff. Nice breakfast & good dinner. Highly recommended to everyone!  No sun umbrellas at the pool"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"The breakfasts were made to order , well prepared and balanced. As a celiac I have to be careful to avoid gluten contamination and on arrival we were met by the chef who listened carefully to my dietary needs. As a result I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts and dinners we had. The standard of the restaurant is under-rated. Nothing."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.2 ,"Nice small new resort, helpful and friendly staff,good breakfast,,walking distance from the nearest town Tangalle. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Near bars and restaurants, personel was ready to help any time. Clean room and perfect place to stay. I didn’t want to move to the next hotel :) The breakfast was quite small, plate of fruits and for example omelet with toast bread. Nothing special."

Quiet location with an easy walk into the town. Literally on the beach and decent pool.  I think the price is a little high for Sri Lanka but not excessively so. Not many vegetarian options in the lunch menu and not many Sri Lankan options either so the menu could easily become boring if staying longer than 3 or 4 days. The sea was rough the whole time I was there (not hotel’s fault but something to be aware of if it’s important to you) but there are coves with calmer waters in the area so just ask reception. "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"This hotel was just amazing . The architecture and design of the hotel is beautiful with every detail thought of.
The rooms are enormous with all you need and a huge bed so comfortable .
The hotel is on the beach with sun loungers and a super pool .
Breakfast was delicious with a great choice and also very good restaurant. The manager of the dining room was very helpful.
Can highly recommend and hope to return Nothing"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Everything was really great: the decoration, the light, the space and confort of the room and all the hotel. I complained about a little problem on the curtain, and they immediatly did an upgrade of the room, for free :) and for the breakfast everyone was kindly cooperative to addapt it to my vegan diet. Thank you so much! Sometimes there was a lot of staff by the pool, which was not so confortable.. but still, was amazing! Maybe it would be nice to have a bigger dining room...just a suggestion!"
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Very good location. Just few minutes walk to bars and restaurants. Nice beaches just 5 -10 minutes drive by tuk tuk. Very comfortable bed, nice, big and well cleaned rooms. Delicious breakfast. 
Staff always nice and helpful. 
Definitely recommend "
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Such a gorgeous, friendly, stylish and comfortable hotel. Staff really are charming and went out of their way to make sure we were happy and looked after. The hotel itself is incredibly peaceful and relaxing. It’s right on the beach front so the only noise you hear is the ocean. We paid just a little extra for a room with a beach view and it was 100% worth it. Was like our own little private patch of paradise.I can’t recommend this place enough; really an exceptional stay."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"Really nice place! We stayed there 5 nights, and really want to come back. Room was big and clean, really good baby cot. Staff was friendly and helpful. Really good and clean pool. Food was great. Good location. Waves at the beach was quite heavy, not so nice to swim,"

golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 9.6 ,"The hotel was lovely, right on the beach just a short walk from the town where there was an interesting market, bus station, money changing facilities and all of the bustle of every day life.
The room was large and tastefully decorated, the bed was massive with good quality linen. The air on was quiet and efficient. The bathroom and shower superb.
Breakfast was good and satisfying, served on the lawn near the beach.
The common areas of the hotel are really attractive and make you feel that you are in somewhere special.
Best till last!
The situation of the hotel on a beautiful quiet beach. Perfect.
If we had not already paid for our hotel in our next location we would have asked to extend our stay. Nothing.
Filter coffee at breakfast would have been better than instant - but this is just me being a coffee snob."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,"no lifts so you have to walk up stairs to rooms! excellent garden area for a meal or drink for breakfast lunch or dinner, amazing food prepared by the chef a must try is their rice and curry combos and the seafood fried rice! the large fish pond on the ground floor provides a very relaxing way to to idle a while as you pass thru the hotel. no ceiling fan above the bed - you had to use the AC the whole time."
golden-pearl-tangalle-beach, 10 ,Our stay was amazing. The view is beautiful and rooms are very clean. They upgraded us 2 days  to water front view no extra charge. Great location to go and have dinner every night grilled seafood on the beach. We will be back The food at the hotel they could do a little more around lunch time and afternoon with drinks and meals we just went next door and they pay bought food over for us.

"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 5.4 ,The suite was absolutely gorgeous The staff were nowhere near as good as some of the lesser rated hotels we stayed in. It was very much run as a corporate enterprise with no personal touches. They need to know how to manage guest expectations and respond when requested to do something.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 5.0 ,"The pool The staff always overcharge u
Especially in there lounge "

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.0 ,"Excellent room. Perfect view.  The strength of the hotel is really the staff.  Farosh is an excellent waiter and provided impeccable service during our seek at the hotel.  Nadeeka is a great asset in the kid's club and is an extremely talented painter.  Ask for his water colors! The pandemic has contributed to a significant loss in clientele.  The pool area is poorly maintained.  The deck is cracked is many places.  The crows are not chased away and this is bird excrement in many places. The management had to be reminded several times to have other guests respect the coronavirus guidelines.  To their credit, they did pretty consistently."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.0 ,Awesome 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Breakfast and dinner are diversified. The hotel has access direct to the beach which has a very fine sand. Despite of the fact there are many surfers you can enjoy to swim in the ocean. The room was exact like on the hotel presentation, very clean and the view amazing.The staff is professional and willing to fulfill your wishes. Everything was perfect"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,The room and the view excellent  The sea food restaurant  ..the chefs are not knowledgeable on cooking the fish as per clients requirements...the price is high but no value 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Room was spacious and comfortable. Right on the beach with a great view of the ocean and the surfers. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Within walking distance of plenty of restaurants. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. Hotel arranged car transport to the airport. The property had not received my reservation from Booking so I had to wait about an hour and a half to get my room. Security in the front of the building is good, but anyone can walk in off the beach from the back side. No security."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 6.2 ,"The only good part about this hotel is the pool manager Charith and his staff around the pool (especially the man who served us most of the holiday with black raybans) who were EXCELLENT - more people needed like this team!  The reception staff are hopeless - we arrived at 5am after a 15 hour journey, no drink, no hand towel, not able to use the facilities to even changed we were told we could use the toilets. Closed currency, had withdrawn English money to exchange there - unable to as it had a pen mark on, it was slightly ripped. Not only think ishak made us feel like we were bringing in false money, and truthfully we felt very uncomfortable. Luckily for us we had no problem leaving the hotel but for anyone who didn’t feel comfortable leaving and finding a place to exchange money this was a pretty poor service from a 5* resort. Now let me get onto water - free everywhere except the bars unless you queried it then it was free? How many people are paying for water when it is free everywhere?? More sun beds are needed some on the beach would have been nice as as soon as you leave your bed for a drink another person takes it - even if you have your things there. We decided to have a drink in the upstairs bar for my birthday, I asked for a disoranno on the rocks after 10 mins the waitress came back - they don’t have this it’s finished, OK that’s fine - I will have a Pinot then.... 15 mins later - don’t have that either. At this point there is nothing else on the menu I fancy so we said we would leave it, they THEN decided to check other bars for my first choice, disoranno. Question is - should this not have been done the second I asked for it and they realised they didn’t have any? 
We did get upgraded but it was always as an apology / an after thought rather than it being right the first time. Real shame as it is a stunning hotel, just the front end staff are useless and rude. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.5 ,"Excellent location on an amazing beach. Which you can walk directly onto from the hotel.
The staff in general were great especially in the lobby tides bar area. The pool area needs to be refurbished. The decking area could be dangerous as some of the decking has risen. More comfortable sun beds and general face lift is required."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 2.0 ,The staff member Sehan was very friendly and helpful. There was a fault with the panic alarm that first went off 10 mins after my arrival. Security came to inspect and it was obvious it was faulty electronics. This happened 3 more times. 11:30pm and 4:30am both times we were woken up and had several people enter the room. Then again in the morning. Needless to say this was a horrible experience and very poor sleep with little rest.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.5 ,"Reception welcoming.
Housekeeping.
The chef. The was often wet at the G level."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 5.4 ,"Room was nice and clean, and had a fantastic view of the ocean Service was terrible. Not what you’d expect from a 5 star. Had to ask multiple times for anything. Multiple reminders. Took the staff an hour to bring my luggage to my room and that was only after I went back down to reception and pointed to the luggage I had called multiple times for "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.1 ,"The hotel is in an excellent location right on the beach which is greta for surfing and playing in the waves,and you have an incredible view of the ocean. The rooms were comfortable and able to accommodate a family of 4. Our kids loved the kids club, lots of things to do, and nice a cool. The check in process was incredibly slow, and compared to the other 5 star hotels we stayed on in this trip was painful, we waited over 30 mins to get our keys. We are a family of 4 (2 kids, 4 and 6) and despite phoning the hotel in advance of our stay they said I couldn't fit my family into 1 room, therefore I booked 2 interconnecting rooms to accommodate us (paying double for the extra room). Even when I was checking in I asked the reception if i could get all of us into one room, and was told I couldn't. We got the keys and checked the rooms, one room had 2 queen beds and a sofa bed, so could easily accommodate us. I returned to reception to cancel 1 room and move us all into the other one. Initially they insisted I paid a cancellation charge, and after an argument and a discussion with the reception manager they agreed to waive any cancellation charges.....Not a great start to the Marriott experience.  The food is average for a 5 star hotel, i have had much more better selection and quality at other hotels in Sri Lanka. The Staff in the restaurant do what they can to assist and help you. The restaurant is cramped, there are too many tables forced in and very little space to walk around the various stations, on 2 separate occasions waiters walked into us. The staff who manage the drink and food orders at the pool are shocking. On 3 separate occasions (we stayed 4 days) I waited over 25 minutes for our drinks orders (and it isn't busy), 1 time our food came before the sprite that we ordered. There were some strange smells around the hotel, near the lifts on the ground floor, and as you enter the kids club, never worked out what it was."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.5 ,"The SPA, rooms.Nice restaurant staff. Gambas was not fresh despite the high price.Late Checkout was not possible unless to pay additional 50% for few hours."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 6.7 ,Niets Alles
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 4.2 ,"First of all I must express that you should lower your expectations from hotels and their stars in Sri Lanka. The hotel’s building is the biggest one in the whole coastal area, the number of travelers(tourists) are high and the pool is tiny and not in proportion to the number of rooms and hotel residents. The number of crows are surprisingly more than the number of people , in a way you should be careful not to bump into crows. The lobby is vast , the breakfast buffet is very various and delicious that I have not seen its like anywhere else. The room terrace is so spacious that you can sit on it and enjoy the coastal view. Toilets and bathrooms in this hotel far exceed the hotel itself. Crows in pool"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 6.2 ,"The rooms were very nice and cleanbreakfast and dinner were great, staff in the restaurant was really really friendly! We travel a lot, and we have been to many 5 star hotels all around the world so far - but our stay at Marriott Weligama Bay was by far the worst stay in a 5 star hotel ever. There were so many dissapointing things happening that we will certainly never come back to Marriott Weligama Bay, and also very likely never ever book a Marriott hotel in any other location.Check in time is 15.00. We had to wait after a long travel until 15.40 until we get our room. We had to ask for that three times because nobody really cared about that.It's not allowed to take surfboards to the room. There was nothing about that in the hotel directives. If we would know that before, we would not book this hotel. The surfboard is a valuable for us. We had to put the boards in the luggage room, were construction work was going on and people put their luggage in. We discuss this with the front office manager very long, but he couldn't give us a compromise. While we were waiting for the manager in front of the luggage room, the room was open and everybody could go inside.The pool area was small. People ""reserved"" their chairs with towels before they went to breakfast. So nobody was lying at the pool but everything was ""reserved"". We never had the chance to use the pool because we didn't go to breakfast at 7.00am.One night we went to bed early around 9.30pm. Then somebody of the cleaning staff startet to do the hoovering in the corridor of our level. At 9:30pm with a super noisy hoover! So apparently the cleaning staff was coordinated so badly that they weren’t able to do the cleaning work at daytime.The hotel wanted us to pay for the airport transfer more than 200USD for a 2-3hr drive is so over-priced and close to a rip-off. In front of the hotel is a Taxi service. We took a taxi there, it was much cheaper.I could write some more disappointing things, but this would not fit in here..."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"Amazing views, staff were so helpful and welcoming I thought the hotel was a little dark in hall ways and walking through gym and restaurant sections"

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"
A one of a kind hotel, truly worth experiencing. I visited with my husband and our 3 year old son. The team at the hotel went above and beyond in everything they offered and are extremely proactive.
Here are a few things we experienced:
Housekeeping: The rooms were always cleaned up well and every time we came back to our room we would find a beautiful towel designed in the shape of a different animal everyday!! Extremely fun if you have kids.
Food: Roshan, Sandeep, Mohammed Akhil and Dilshan took great care of us. They made sure they cater to any of our request and would gladly always offer to make a special meal for our son!! On one of the days we went for a whale watching tour at 6:00AM and Sandeep asked what exactly we needed to pack a take away bag for us and also made a special bag for our son. Not to forget, the food is AAAMAZING, you’ll find everything and anything!
Kids Club: The best we’ve seen!! Nimasha, is extremely talented with children. We LOVED her!! She always welcomed our son and would always let him leave with a special gift made by her. 
The room is well equipped and there were nice programs for our son and other kids to enjoy - from dancing, arts and crafts to movie time.
Celebration: The team managed to help my husband plan a beautiful birthday surprise so smoothly. Rashmi and her team decorated the room and served us a private dinner in the most elegant form.
All in all, worth every penny and highly recommended if you are visiting Sri Lanka. We will definitely be back!
 Would be nice to have extra light built in the room, but that could be a personal preference."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"Everything is ok, except the room price.
Exquisite room decorations, good views from rooms, nice beach, amazing two swimming pools, and several restaurants or pubs can meet most of guests from different countries. Excellent restaurant stall and chefs are very professional. Anyway, anything you can think of can be fulfilled here, which all deserve a high quality 5-star hotel. I believe that it is one of top 5 hotels in Mirissa. The room price fluctuates too dramatically. When I booked this hotel half a month before I would arrived at it, the room price was average $250 one night during the period between October 4 and 6. Unfortunately, when I checked the room price about September 30, the room price had reduce almost 50%. It was so sad and I had no opportunity to cancel. The more ridiculous, when I checked out, the room price increased than I booked online. The reception told me the room price would fluctuate automatically according to how many people would want to book this hotel. For example, if some day, too many people book the hotel at the same time, the price may increase and if not, the price may decrease. I never met such condition, to be honest.  "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,We had a lovely 5 days at the resort. For a big hotel the service and staff are lovely and go above beyond to make sure you are looked after. Asela our room attendant made sure our room was spotless everyday and even left us surprise towel animals around the place. On our last night we wanted to eat at the big fish restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for a function so we ended up beginning our night at the tide bar with a drink. We decided to eat there as we were enjoying it so much and were glad we did. Chef Shanuka and Dinesh made us delicious food and even came to our table with little extra treats to try. Overall a great experience at the hotel.

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"The food was great, especially breakfast. The view from the balcony was fantastic and the staff were all so lovely  The food and drink was very expensive. The pool area wasn’t comfortable as the sun beds were too close together. No toilet roll replaced, no robes, slippers or room service menu in our room. We had to ask for robes and having been without a replacement toilet roll for 2 days we had to go find a house boy to get one.  The pool bar would not serve me a coke before 11am. Not the hotel’s fault exactly but a large (150 strong) group on all inclusive were very noisy, drunk most of the time, took over the pool area and this did impact our stay "

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Exceptional hotel, with amazing facilities. The hotel has direct access to the beach, which is great if you want to learn to surf. Very safe and plenty of activities."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Loved our stay here!! The rooms are so luxurious with the best view. The staff are very helpful and always available. The food was really good, we tried all restaurants and would recommend them all, even room service was outstanding. Breakfast is especially good, so much selection! Can’t say a bad word, could have stayed here for our entire holiday. Great access to the beach and a good sized pool. I would highly recommend staying here! There are also lots of restaurants within walking distance too, nice not to have to take a tuk tuk for a change. Also if you like surfing we found Weligama to have the best waves."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.3 ,"Kids club, swimming pools , Beach side, room size  Room value "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Great location in the middle of Weligama bay, which has great consistent rollers - ideal for learning to surf.The dining area is an open kitchen with different areas for various regional cuisines, making for a great buffet. When we couldn't find something, like guacamole, they made it for us, whilst we waited. The food was great, offering lots of variety and fresh produce. Despite being told we could have room from 11:00, it was well after lunch before our room was ready. It was always half an hour away... Having flown through the night and driven three hours to get there, we just wanted to unpack and flop."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.3 ,"Location and accommodation condition When we arrived, the male hotel attendant was not so friendly"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,Pool area was pretty and great location for surfing and sunsets. Everything you would expect from this type of hotel... arrive hungry as the buffets are very good! Snack food in the bar (just behind reception) was very poor. I suggest sticking to the buffet.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"I loved my stay here, the staff was so accommodating, the food was great, room was fabulous! The spa treatments was a little over priced and not as good as expected for a five star hotel. The pedicure and Indian head massage in particular."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,Excellent location on the beach - rooms are amazing with stunning view on the sea. Super big bathroom. Easy Surfing right in front of the hotel. Swimming pool is a little too small compare to the size of the hotel.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The best hotel ever !! Thanks for a nice time , it is a shame that I don't have the same staff in my company in Poland :D"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Everything was perfect! We love the twin double bedroom, clean and beautiful ocean view. The food quality is very nice. The staffs are so friendly and helpful.  Nothing. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Fabulous location. Great staff. The chefs Sandeep and crew were jst great. Food was amazing. Loved every bit
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,The food was great. The room was great. The people were very nice. I would for sure recommend this hotel. Nothing. 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.3 ,The room was spacious and beautiful. The bed was very comfortable. The building itself is huge and out of proportion with anything else surrounding it and is actually quite an eyesore when viewed from the beach. Certainly not the place for a romantic stay. Caters for large groups.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.9 ,"Nice location. Wonderfull view. Nice facilities. Good food. Kindness of staff except front deskConfy bed and confortable room Effectiveness & kindness of front desk staff (4 pers). We had to wait 3,5 h to get our room (though some were available ones as the house keeper confirmed) !Poor organization for this kind of hotel, as they lost our luggages after checking out (20 mn to find them back).Cleaness on some areas good be better."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,Its amazing hotel and superb service all The way Nothing Best holidays ever
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.3 ,The beach few and food
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"It’s a big (~200 rooms), all inclusive hotel, where you can get anything you wish for. The location is right on the beach. Kids club was very good, our daughter returned there again and again. The food was also good, especially the Asian part of the buffet. We got a free upgrade to a higher floor and the room was very spacious. The hotel is only a couple of years old, so everything is fresh and modern. Nice swimming pools. If you’re into all inclusive hotels, then this is the right place for you. After our stay here we understood that we are not. The staff was polite most of the time, but overworked and tired. A lot of fake smiles, not paying attention to the details, forgetful (had to ask for my coffee twice at breakfast on two occasions, the chef assumed we were Russian even though we are not, etc.) The beach is nice, but, ironically, the hotel itself looks so out of place on it (a huge concrete monster) that it lacks any charm. A lot of novice surfers in the water (I mean, hundreds of them). Interesting to watch them from afar, but if you go swimming, can get hit by a surf board easily. There are other much nicer, more secluded beaches in Sri Lanka. Lots of Russian residents, who are infamous worldwide for being impolite."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Friendly people, nice hotel, relaxed atmosphere"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The all inclusive meals offered fantastic variety. After spending the first 2 weeks in Sri Lanka looking for restaurants that appeared clean, and where you do not have to totally douse yourself in mosquito repellent to survive dinner, it was very relaxing to walk into the restaurant at the Marriott. You have to be prepared for the prices. A hint is, do not compare them to other paces in Sri Lanka, compare them with northern European prices and understand what it takes to maintain the property, standard and the staff at the Marriott."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"The rooms are so comfortable and clean 
Breakfast was amazing 
We had a very nice stay "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"The breakfast was wonderfull!Location is nice!Facillity is superb!They have 24-ours check-out.The sea views outstuning.Wi-fi nice too. I would like that they have a sauna.I would like that they more green plants outside and the  biggest waterpool. More fruits to breakfast."

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,The view and bathroom were amazing!
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"The breakfast buffet was immense. The Sri Lankan and Indian dishes were the best. 
Every member of staff was wonderful. They seemed to go out of their way to make your holiday perfect. I can honestly say that I would stay in a Marriott again just based on the incredible customer service I experienced.  We were disappointed that considering this is a 5* beach hotel, that there's actually no beach for guests. To the immediate right of the hotel are lots of surf schools, which take up the beach and all of the water. To the immediate left are lots of beached fishing boats, and all the detritus that comes with them. Hotel staff prevent you from taking towels onto the beach even if it was worth going into it. 
The gym is small but well appointed but is incredibly hot, the aircon really needs to be improved. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Great place to relax. Large international hotel with all the comfort you want after exploring Sri Lanka. Room, service, garden, pool, food - excellent. Beach for swimming and surfing. --"

Very friendly staff and the room was great  Nothing"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"The location is amazing , beach is great for surfing . Our check in and communication with the hotel was a disaster Sent numerous emails direct to the hotel replying to their welcome emails , not one was answered .Also on checkin they did not have our room type available even though we confirmed the day before. At 1am we had to wait over an hour for the manger with 2 children . In the end we were given a temporary room and had to move in the morning. They didn’t except any responsibility and seemed to think it was ok to expect one of us to sleep on the floor !  Before you arrive get an email response confirming your room type. Have all your confirmation printed out as I was expected to find my trail of emails to prove I was telling the truth which I did have !"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,Food delicious . Room clean and staff very friendly More comfortable sun loungers
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,The hospitality of the staff and the breakfast was simply amazing. Loved their room service the food ordered through the in room dinning menu was better than what we expected.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Staff very attentive and helpful No coasters for drinks
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Breakfast was great and plentiful. The hotel is new, luxorious and very clean. The hotel is right next to the beach and the poolarea is beautiful. Staff was friendly.  We stayed in the first floor and we could hear the music (bass) from the ballroom downstairs. There was party for three nights (until 01:00 and 03:00 am) and those nights we didn't sleep well. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,The staff are amazing. So super friendly especially the guys down at the pool bar!

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Great luxurious hotel
Great modern room with an amazing view from the balcony
You forget that’s you’re in srilanka
You won’t have the desire to leave the resort Nothing"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,The property was beautiful and facilities were amazing. Check in was done late despite our late arrival. Took way too long to get our bags down for checkout.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"Friendly staff, good facilities, nice ambience and very customer oriented. Keep at it and keep improving. Dinner buffet selection needs to be worked at. The dinner buffet spread"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Location is great. The hotel is overlooking Welligama Bay. The rooms are beautifully designed. The staff are friendly especially the chef in the breakfast restaurant. We had to leave really early and we nearly missed breakfast but the staff gave us boxes to pack some food to go.  When we asked for happy hour, the reception people told us it was at 7pm. We headed to the bar at 7pm, happy hour was over. The soup at the Big Fish came to us cold. When we told this to the staff, the manager talked to us and immediately rectified the situation. They even gave us free wine. One night, a man was knocking outside our door and rang the bell numerously. I informed the front desk and the security people were fast to act. They should also do something about their very slow lift. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"We loved everything about Weligama Bay Marriott Resort. Excellent customers service. Beautiful  views from our lovely very  comfortable room,such attention to  detail. We really enjoyed  the breakfast and dinner buffet. Delicious variety and choice of different  cuisines .Attentive, kind and obliging chefs and staff. I had a great  experience at the  zquan Spa  .Great neach side and surfing  too!Highly recommend staying at this  property in Weligama. 
"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.9 ,The view from the room was amazing as well as the room. Amazing hotel! I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT THE HOTEL STAFF CHARGED ME AN EXTRA FEE using CREDIT CARD while checking out!!!! ---- Please remember to pay in local currency otherwise the hotel will charge you and extra 20% if you pay in USD or GBP or other currency!!!!!!!!!!!
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Staff were very attentive and made you feel that they really did care. The setting was idea, and the room was very comfortable and kept clean. Bhagyashree Khanvilkar checked us in and help us out several times over the week, she was exceptional and went out of her way to make sure everything was alright. We booked through booking.com, the advice was to pay in USD dollars so I put dollars on my Thomas Cook cash passport. What a mistake, it caused extra charges of a purse conversion fee 93.58$ plus another charge of 150€, why it took euros first was because it was closest to the British pound. Best to pay with a debit card in the local currency to avoid this problem and the worry."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,Delicious food with a great variety. Pool was amazing with several places to sit. Staff at the pool and restaurant were great as well. Room with ocean view also worth it. Food was very expensive for sri lanka as well as the tours offered by the hotel
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Beautiful hotel - amazing beach Food options limited outside of the buffet whic was good
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Terrific location, room layout, service and view. You don't have a view of the beach from the pool. The buffet was not extensive enough (few varieties from one cuisine). Feels more like a hotel than a resort."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"This resort was absolutely perfect! The beach location , resort facilities, food and most outstanding customer service. The staff were so kind welcoming and polite and always willing to go the extra mile to make our stay better. As a pregnant woman myself I felt all my needs were taken care of! We would definitely recommend this hotel."

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,Friendly staff and nice hospitality  Overpriced 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The location, beach, view, rooms The service needs improvement, especially in the restaurant buffet"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"A beautifully presented resort, with welcoming and attentive staff.Plenty of seating around the pool area, lovely swimming pools, and right on the beach. Staff brought free drinks and fresh watermelon to guests around the pool multiple times throughout our stay.Restaurant absolutely amazing with so much variety to choose from (buffet style breakfast and dinner). Rooms modern, clean and with incredible views of the beaches. Nothing. Absolutely perfect."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"The rooms were modern and the views of the bay were impressive. The pool always seemed to have a turnover of people and finding a lounger to rest was not a problem no matter what time of day . The servers appeared untrained and ill informed , they were lovely people and very helpful but we had a number of issues around seating in the restaurant and also setting and cleaning of the tables for dinner and breakfast  : also while we were there , there was 3 nights of religious holidays and unlike other properties in Sri Lanka we were not informed of the licensing laws on these days . The food was below average in Weligama Kitchen we spent 8 nights in this hotel and the choice was poor . The curries were not on a par with others we have had in Sri Lanka , anything other than chicken was fatty and inedible. The other choices were a daily Asian soup and spaghetti station . The salads were limited and not very tasty.  "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"After a week: Outstanding service, the rooms are very comfortable and the staff ready to help you at all times. Massages were great too. Loved to wake up and check the surf from our bed."

The staff was really friendly and helpfull
Highly recommended "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"This place is amazing! The rooms were spotless and very large. The bed was very comfortable. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The facilities were nice, clean and very enjoyable. One of our best stays in Sri Lanka and we definitely will be coming back soon! The hotel was fully booked when we stayed so the pool was a bit crowded and there were a lot of children. Other than that, no complaints!!"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"The food was amazing and restaurant stuff super friendly and attentive. The best location in Weligama - the beach was amazing. The room spacious, nicely decorated and well designed - especially bathroom. We enjoy our stay very much and we highly recommend this hotel."

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"This hotel is just LUSH, rooms and beds are the best in Sri Lanka if you ask me.Best Mattress ever! The pool service is slow, not enough staff to offer service, i was with friends and we would have spent a lot more money had the staff been prompt to offer menu and take orders."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,We liked almost everything about this hotel! ❤️ The food was great. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. The view from the room was breathtaking. The room was clean. This was one of the best hotels we’ve been to so far!
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,They gave us the highest floor with sea view Nothing. Everything was fantastic
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,Hotel Room and views...
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Everything. An amazing experience.  Nothing. 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.9 ,"Cleanliness, comfy beds, large rooms with great seaview, friendly and very polite staff, spa and gym are good. Pools are very small and shallow. Sea is rough so pools are not present for swimming but only for chilling out. Hotel area is not large enough when its busy. We would expect more social areas or free space. Generally the restaurant is ok but variety of foods can be increased. Sri Lankan and Indian cuisine is ok but bbq and european / mediterrenean cuisine is very weak. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"The room was superb. It was roomier with modern amenities. Balcony view was nice. (We were on first floor. Will be asking for a room at a higer floor next time).  Bathroom was great. Nice spacious setup. Best hot water system i've used..  Nice swiming pools. Careing & super friendly staff.. They were able to give us the room super early. Thank you for that!  Food was quite good. Variety was good as well. We had a nice relaxing time as well as the room was quite. They didnt have the reservation in their system. Made the reservation around 15 hours ago. However they were super nice and got it cleared   out quickly.
We had to wait to get into the buffet for the dinner. We opted for the 9:00 PM and was there at around 9:10.. didnt have to wait long.. but was still a bit strange as i have never faced this in any other hotel. It almost looked like the restaurant was not enough when the hotel was at full occupancy. (Maybe this was a one off thing). The staff member was super nice and even offerd us a drink while we wait."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,Food tasted great however there wasn't a much of a spread/selection in the buffet.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,The location is excellent with rooms facing sea view. A place to relax & enjoy with family. The food was delicious & the staff was friendly & attentive.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Everything. Specially the view. And also the the lady in the reception, Mrs Bishari Anjelica Gamage. She was the sweetest. Nothing. Everything was perfect."

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Great luxury rooms with amazing ocean view!! Friendly staff, especially Athapathu of the breakfast/room service! Strongly recommend it! The fact that the roof top and all but one restaurants were closed for dinner. Recommendation-the spa to offer ayurvedic treatment."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,It was an amazing property. The employees were always going that extra mile to assist and make our stay a memorable one. Awesome experience from check-in to check-out.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,We stayed this hotel as honeymoon with my wife. We reserved as standard type but they gave us upgrade to one of the suite room which was totally awesome. Front Office Mr. Yashoda was making our stay more comfortable since he helped us everything we have asked. I’m sure I’m gonna come back this hotel again. 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The staff were super attentive to our needs and always ready to serve. We felt welcome and looked after throughout our stay. Very easy to travel to. Under two hours from Colombo. Many options to dine. Bathroom was extremely luxurious. Great views. Great beach. Very safe. Always entertained. Phenomenal welcome by front house manager Suraj  We lost water for a couple of hours one morning. We were On the 9th floor.
But we didn’t feel resentful at all as the staff kept us updated at all times till it was back
On."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Outstanding throughout. The hospitality of the staff was superb, truly could not be any better. They helped us so much with everything, including helping us to find a dentist when my boyfriend broke his tooth surfing. Truly impressive service from very kind, professional people, we felt so welcome. 
The hotel is beautifully designed, the sea view from the room was stunning and the room itself was luxurious. Highly recommend the spa; we had a couple’s massage and it was perfect. 
We had both breakfast and dinner here. As a rule, I wouldn’t normally eat every meal in a hotel but the range and quality of food available in both buffets was better than I could ever have imagined. I had the opportunity to sample so many local dishes, although there are so many different types of cuisine available that everybody is catered for. 
Outstanding quality throughout, cannot fault this place. 
"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.3 ,"It was luxurious and the food was amazing! 
The room was clean and comfortable. There were quite a few crows in the outdoor spaces - not anywhere else we encountered so many not sure what they were attracted to but they seem to flock to the Marriott. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"This is the best Marriot hotel I have been to!! Everyone are so worm welcoming, professional and nice:) they remember my name, how I drink my coffee, always ready to help and smiling which made me feel at home"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.0 ,They need to add more seafood in their buffets
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The room was spacious, beautifully clean, cool on arrival which was a really treat. I arrived early and they said I could check in early but would have to wait 30 minutes for the room, but 2 minutes after I sat down with a free wifi password they said my room was ready!! The gym is great and the pool is lovely. I am gluten free, but they made an effort to show me all that was safe for me to eat and made me a special dessert one night! All the staff are friendly and genuinely care how your stay is going You need to take your own towels to the beach, and this was not explained to me, until someone asked me to leave the beach as my towel was a pool towel. This is not a problem, but it would have been nice to be told in advance."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,excellent beaches
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"Pool, closeness to the beach and food provided by the hotel.  The town of Mirssa is very small with nothing much to do. "

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Loved the property, very welcoming and very comfortable stay. Rooms are spacious.  The lift was quite slow but it didn’t impact our experience "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,The bed was amazingly comfy! The view stunning! The rooms so beautiful. We also loved the steam room & the food was outstanding. We simply loved it! We would love to see the hotel cutting out on plastic bottles for environmental reasons.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The swimming pool and the great beach.
Nice and kind stuff
Very clean 
Good service  The food was not that good although there is a big range of food"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,It cannot be a hotel that respects itself and its guests. There will be no basic taxi service These are just hundreds of dollars in vip service. It's very infuriating
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"Top quality service where every guest is a special guest. Wonderfyll
experience and food . Excellent and top staff. Special thanks to Mr.
Indika and Mr. Faiyas - Restaurant Managers. Mr. Emil in Front Desk
 Nothing. Hotel without any mistake from a to z
"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.8 ,"4 members of staff made our stay fantastic:
- Bagashryee- FOH Manager. After confusion with booking she provided a board upgrade, sorted the room fast on check in and checked in on us throughout our stay.
- Mehaan- great cleaner who left the room looking spotless and ensured we had more than enough free water stocked in our room.
- one of the Pool Managers - he sorted out issues with the towels and when other guests took our sun loungers. Very attentive.
- Rooshan - Sous Chef. Answered all my questions about food and gave me tips should I want to recreate some of his fantastic curries at home. 
This hotel felt real luxury in paradise and the food was amazing! - Pillows were rubbish. Feather filled and flat.
- most of the staff didn’t know their own policies around towels, check in to name a few which was frustrating
- more Gluten free options
- No juice on offer for lunch buffet 
- Customers not Informed of large event bookings such as a wedding, so no way to plan around lack of space around the pool that day which meant we had to have a towel on the floor to fit in. Not expected for a 5 Star!"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.9 ,The view of the beach is incredible & the breakfast buffet is excellent. The wait staff & chefs were very lovely & efficient also.  The front counter staff were extremely unhelpful & very slow. The rooms are dated & the room hallway smelt very stale. 
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.6 ,"Good location, nice staffs  The beach is not so clean"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,The staff is very friendly and attentive.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"It has been a beautiful trip. The hotel staff was very friendly. The waiters and the chefs from the Big Fish restaurant were very careful, the food was excellent, they offered us a lot of informations about what we can visit and they organised at Asiri’s intiative a memorable last night. Thank you to Madu from the activity desk which organised for us an excellent trip in the safari and in the searching for the blue whales."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.0 ,Room Breakfast
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Our stay at the Weligama Marriott was the perfect end to 10 days around Sri Lanka. It is large and very comfortable. From the welcome onwards the staff were all exceptional, especially those in the Weligama kitchen. Our ocean vista suite was true indulgence and a tremendous place to stay. We loved every minute. Tiny point but the only thing that got to us was the amount of single use plastic ie small water bottles in both the rooms and the gym - being so close to the Indian Ocean it would be good to see this reduced. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.0 ,"Lovely Hotel with excellent staff, nice setting and very nice room The Hotel should not be contracting out to private parties and then refuse access to the main hotel pool to paying guests and permit private party all day with deafening music"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Amazing! We loved our stay. Included Buffet breakfast was 10/10 - highly recommend, so much to choose from. 
Pool and facilities like gym are awesome, staff just so incredibly friendly and helpful.
Weligama is a very small cute town, not much nightlife but an easy 10min scooter or tuk tuk ride to Marissa which has more action at night along its beach   Very minor - steps in pool need more visual cues as they are hard to see"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Great accommodation with panoramic views of the Indian ocean from your own balcony. Perfect spot to learn surfing right at the entrance to Weligama beach. Extremely hospitable staff throughout the resort.  Nothing.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"There was really loud wedding one day, everything else were great"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.0 ,"The staff is outstanding ! They all go out of their way to make your stay personal and comfortable. Chef Saurabh and the entire team at weligama kitchen, Bhagyashree at the front office,  Manoj and team at Surfs up - all phenomenal! The pool side tends to get super crowded on certain days. They run out of sun beds. The pools and the pool side amenities sometimes are sometimes not adequate for the size of hotel and number of guests thereof."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Just a really nice comfortable stay! The hotel was wonderful and the staff were all really helpful. Room was very nice and clean with a good view and really comfortable. They had a good spread for breakfast and their buffet dinner is also really good!  Beach in front of the hotel doesn’t really have many seats to chill in.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"The rooms were big with incredible view and breakfast was delicious. The staff were friendly. The check in and check out was very average.

"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"This was one of the best hotel stay experiences I've ever had and i travel a lottt. The rooms were impeccably clean and spacious... the beds were comfortable... toilets and bathrooms are always a huge concern for me (they honestly make or break a stay for me) and theirs exceeded my expectations...
The breakfast and dinner buffets were exceptional with a lot of options and cuisines... 
They have multiple pools and direct access to the beach which is amazing... 
Staff is friendly, flexible and attentive...
I'd definitely stay here again and would recommend this to anybody looking for a luxurious getaway...  Absolutely nothing. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Food was absolutely brilliant. The breakfast and dinner buffet was extensive with a variety of items for anybody's taste. The staff was very friendly too. Our room was extremely clean and was large with an excellent view. Amenities were excellent too. 
The beach was clean and well kept.  Check in was a bit of a mess. Initially we got the wrong room number, but the issue was quickly sorted out. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"Beautiful views, great food, direct access to beach. Luxurious room and hotel. Restaurant staff was sometimes slow and very confused like they were stoned. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 7.9 ,"Service, staff, room number. At the begging at the check-in, the lady told us that all rooms with king size bed are booked and not available, so they were trying to offer us a twin bed room. I was a little disappointed as I’ve made the reservation a month prior. After a short argument they’ve finally found a way to give us room with the king size bed. Thanks for that. 
Another thing is that there is no free sauna in the hotel, that’s a pity and also a bit strange. "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,The food was excellant. the pools were great. staff were amazing. rooms were beautifully done and very comfortable. view was amazing! fun water aerobics in the morning.  more vegan dessert options would be great

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.0 ,"Good pools, kids club Haphazard service in restaurant"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.0 ,very good excellent choices for breakfast with western and traditional sri lankan options. My wife and I always enjoy the choices available for breakfast at Marriot weligama. Booking the Hotel was disappointing this was our fourth trip and managing to secure a room directly was very difficult and the customer service was poor. Considering I am a repeat customer I expected better treatment from the reservations department.
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Everything from service to the hotel's look/design. The staff were very nice and friendly. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The pool area was very nice. The location was great. We will definitely stay there again. Nothing really
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Beachfront hotel with exceptional hospitality from the staff.. great foods. Enjoyed the stay...
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Our whole experience from start to finish at Marriott Weligama Bay was fantastic. We came with high expectations. Our experience went way beyond. Instantly, the refreshing atmosphere, the professional yet warm welcome inspires confidence. Location is perfect, in front of the beach, with 2 swimming pools, surrounded by grass and palm trees, in between.Our room was spacious, perfectly clean, with a high-end bathroom and quality bedding. Beautiful ocean view, balcony with comfy seats, which was perfect to relax at sunset. We can not emphasise enough about how great the buffet is: 3 cuisines, with a huge variety of styles and tastes. Local, asian, western, fruits, juices, shakes, live cooking, everything prepared to perfection.But what made our stay unforgettable is clearly Marriott-crew! Customer service is stellar, even considering its high-class category. All the staff is extremely attentive, everybody did their best to ensure us the best experience possible, going far above what we expected. They really care. A mix of great humanity and professionalism, well balanced, that made a big difference. Special thanks to Isuru, Pamuditha, Udara!We booked 2 nights, then extended to 9! We would highly recommend Marriott Weligama Bay. A highlight of our holiday."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.0 ,Staff really friendly and helpful
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Breakfast was splendid, especially the room service. Thanks again to the amazing staff who worked hard to exceed's customer's expectations. The swimming pool was a little small with cramped chairs. But you do have the wonderful beach to go too."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Friendly and always helpful staff, delicious food and beautiful views on the beach from apartments. Definitely great place to stay! After 3 days in the hotel, we have decided to spend here one more week. :-) "
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"Great place to stay in Weligama - rooms are spacious, bathroom is really clean and the bed is super comfy! I slept like an angel ;) the views from the room and the balcony are stunning - beautiful ocean and beach at sunrise and sunset; you have direct access to the beach from the hotel; the staff is really super friendly and very helpful in all means - especially now with the Corona situation, they went above and beyond to help me in that special situation; the pool is very nice for relaxation and drinks/food can be ordered easily; the breakfast buffet was rich with Continental and Asian options; for dinner you can enjoy a delicious buffet, eat a la carte at the lounge or treat yourself at the Seafood Restaurant; all in all it was a great stay and high quality standards by Marriott - would definitely come back again Prices for food and drinks are quite high for Sri Lanka standards, but I guess you'll have that at every upper class hotel; I could imagine that it gets quite crowded at the pool area when the hotel is fully occupied as the pool area is a bit tight"
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Awesome
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,"The view, the comfortable bed, great wifi, the food, the kind staff. It was brilliant but the decking around the pool did present a slip hazard in places."

I dont think it is soundproof thoughBreakfast was a buffet arrangement and was very good.For lunch & dinner we had set menus and food portions were very genrousStaff was super friendly and polite. Kudos :) No buffet for the lunch or dinner (except one dinner). They were going with a set menus.But I guess due to reduced visitors, it is not feasible to maintain a buffet. But still, a stripped down buffet would be greatHotel area is entirely the building, not much thing to do except going to the beach"

The front desk team, the service team, the kitchen team, everybody was warmly welcoming us and tried all their best to make our stay extraordinary. We can only recommend staying there. The food was very delicious with a huge choice at the breakfast and dinner buffet. We even got a free upgrade to stay at a suite for a few nights. A big bonus: if you like to surf, you can just jump into the water right in front of the hotel area. Thank you to Suranga Peelikumbura, Indika Nishantha Hettiarachchi, Saurabh Matheshwari, Mohamed Akeel Malik, Bhagyashree Khanvilkar, Randula Priyadasun."

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.0 ,"Food arrangements and the staff was excellent. Sri Lankan authentic food taste was superb. The room was one of the top best I have experienced. It had luxury world class standards. I lived outside Sri Lanka for sometime, but I must say the experience I had here was outstanding. The friendly lovely staff was the cherry on top. Keep that up. Words cannot explain the service staff provides, and overall all the experience this hotel gives to all guests. It is exceptional. I liked every bit of it. I felt I would be happier if the taste was bit more authentic when it comes to foreign foods . Example pasta , bacon taste had a bit more room for improvements. But I must say Sri Lankan authentic food taste was excellent."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 10 ,Room is excellent with great view.. Food cannot complaint.. No complains but food can be upgraded..

weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 9.2 ,"From Staff, location, ambient, food to cleanliness of rooms are some of the best things about the Hotel.  Parking seemed to be an issue since it is located around 100-150 meters from the property. There is Valet but it takes a good 10-15 minutes for them to bring it."
weligama-bay-marriott-resort-spa, 8.0 ,It was a nice experience. I stayed with my wife just one week after our honeymoon. Room was in excellent condition. Restaurants and the buffet were really good with large variety of cuisine. Beach and the pool were nice. Only issue was that the hotel was too crowded during that weekend. Staff was really friendly. Actually it was a good stay. The hotel get too crowded during Saturday and Sunday morning.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was great, especially when you all beautiful animals walk around you there. Very professional staff especially our villa assistant Isuru, he was just a five star assistant.  Nothing at all. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,The location is absolutely stunning. Amazing surfing spots around the resort and superb restaurants. All the staff is extremely friendly and there is a fair share of facilities to keep you busy.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,The fact that the entry level bedroom is sensational says all you need to know - the quality here is incredible. Very well appointed rooms. Stunning food (breakfast amazing and Frutti de mare pasta at Il Mare was wonderful) and great setting. A really enjoyable stay. Shafni was a fantastic host. Exorbitant drinks prices - £38 for 2 Aperol Spritz. Continual addition of service charge + taxes is daylight robbery. Kids screaming and shouting in the pool.

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 3.8 ,"Good beach, nice pool and a good choice of food in the restaurant (highly priced though) My child got poisoned with the milk in mini bar and got sick ( temperature and so on) Do you think anyone took care of us? We felt that for the staff it wasn’t much of importance. I asked for late check out because we could not leave the hotel with a sick child. They gave us extra 2 hours. They helped only after MANY MANY efforts from my side. Had to call the reception, waited, waited, waited. We had high expectations from a hotel with such a high rating. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a complete disappointment. - you feel lost among hundreds of guests and we didn’t feel much privacy- no help from reception until I came and demanded what I asked for on the phone an hour ago - in emergency situation they are indifferent Like it was totally OUR PROBLEM that our child got FOOD POISONING from their food.The staff is polite and smiles. But you feel that it’s fake(( We had such a positive experience with other hotels where we stayed on Sri Lanka. With much more hospitality, much better food and generally, much better conditions."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 7.5 ,The extra bed was not comfortable at all
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 5.0 ,the beach is beautiful. there are not beach activities. the food is not good for a 5 star resort. the resort becomes really boring after sundown. the price doesn't match with the place features. the staff is not helpful.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 5.8 ,"faciliaties and resort location is beautiful the mattress/bed was squeaquing every time we turned waking us up all the time. for the price charged i would reccomend replacing the beds by nice up to standard beds. the bathrooms are modern but there is no glass between shower and toilet so the bathroom ends up getting all wet, would be better to put a glass wall separating the area. the sea in front of the hotel is quite rough.

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"The view of the breakfast location was so awesome. It was so relaxing and calm just listening to the waves of the ocean and the chirping of the birds. For the three days we stayed there, I felt relaxed. You should try the spa and have a sri lankan massage, its so relaxing. We were on the half board and it would be more better if there are more restaurant option opened or maybe buffet style dinner with different theme every night."

There was no crowd, always plenty of space at swimming pool and beach areas, lovely food, great coctails, excellent service. Everyone of the staff was smiling all the time, and was maximum helpful. The rooms are faboulus! Spacious, comfortable, and clean. Really effective moskito system made us forget about those. Besides my cons below, it really was a perfect place. Couldn't swim in sea as it had too powerful current, and was a bit rocky. tough the scenery was amazing. Also beaches are public in sri lanka meaning mercants or random people could just approach you during a tan. Minibar was pricy.Also i could see the tv's cable. wrost place ;)"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything about this resort was on point.  Beautifully appointed room with views of the ocean.  Every luxurious amenity you could want at your fingertips.  Housekeeping was amazing.  Staff made our experience special and personalized our stay.

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"We absolutely loved this amazing resort.  It was perfect from the moment we arrived.  The staff everywhere were exceptional.  The room was fabulous with a great view of the ocean.  The food in Journeys restaurant was fantastic and we had the fish and chicken curry rather than the buffet - to die for!  Restaurant and pool staff had great personalities and lovely to talk to to get an insight into their country. We never wanted to leave. There was nothing to dislike.  We were a little disappointed that the Customer Services Manager who came around talking to guests was not a Sri Lankan National and she didn't really ""fit in"".  She was also incredibly rude to breakfast staff (who were divine) one morning (in front of guests) when a bird stole some food from an unattended table."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The staff and the manager : Mr. Anantha , was extremely courteous and cooperative and accommodative.The Indian CHEF, SUBHASH, was very good and prepared special indian food for us, which really made our day.All the rooms were tidy, extremely luxurious, with a superb view of the ocean.Though the SEA was rough but the beaches and SMALL ROCKS were good enough to enjoy the sea water.The LAGOOON BOATING was also good. NOTHING,"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"We visited during low season and were offered a discounted rate for an upgrade to an ocean villa. I appreciate that this won’t always be available, and we were grateful to accept the offer. The villa was spectacular, as good as any high end accommodation we have had. Very clean, well decorated, large and comfortable. The private plunge pool and patio were super. 
The staff were very nice and always greeted us with a smile. The restaurants and lounger were also good.  This is just a minor nit, but one area of improvement would be related to delivery of services. I sent some laundry for cleaning, and was not delivered back to me until I called to follow-up. I had to call for follow-up on a few other occasions as well. The issues were minor and non-impactful, but it would be something that could be improved. "

 Distance from the airport to the hotel "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Very kind staff, everyone cares, food was delicious!!!! (we are Italian and understand well when an Italian restaurant for ex. is not like in Italy). Buffets extraordinary and great dinner and breakfast. Excursions were awesome and we enjoyed even the SPA. Isuru helped us out on every quest3we had and was very available.
Our driver Manjula was even very kind and explained everything on our excursion to rhe rock temple. Thank you for this awesome timw. We will comw back again.  Everything was perfect in our stay at anantara "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The staff are excellent and remember your preferences with your food and drink etc, you really feel taken care of here. The rooms and property is spacious and modern and there’s some good inclusions such as products and water in the room as well as a complimentary nature walk (Eddie is very good) the attention to detail in the grounds and service is what makes this place so special. Food at the Italian restaurant is gorgeous - make sure you book the restaurants as they can get busy. Nothing "

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.3 ,"Great location. Great food. Great staff. Bit overprised when taking in the account the venue was not 100% maintained (i.e. uncovered/broken sewer hatches). Our 12 months old son was with us: babysitting available only for children 2+ years of age and high chairs at restaurants were not in perfect condition. Anyways, it is still one of the best resort in Sri Lanka"

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The service/staff in this hotel is outstanding: nothing is too much trouble for them; always with a smile and very friendly. Rooms are very comfortable, spacious and full of light. The pounding sea makes a perfect ""musical"" background. Great pools, both big enough for lap-swimming. All in all: an absolute positive experience – highly recommended! Food is very good – but not up to the highest standards."

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"We were travelling for honeymoon and really enjoyed our stay here in Tangalle. Beautiful location on the south coast, this resort hotel has great facilities to ensure a great and romantic stay. We were allocated our own Butler Isuru who tailored our stay and was available via WhatsApp which was a great idea to keep us informed about going-ons at the resort and helped with our spa and restaurant bookings. The Sri Lankan 'Teppanyaki' experience at one of their restaurants was absolutely fantastic and comes well-recommended, our personal chef on the night kept us entertained and the food was great! The spa was excellent. Better film choices on the television but overall, great stay."

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Amazing breakfast with great variety and even a smoothie bar and a corner with gluten free goodies which I found great. The politeness and kindness of all hotel staff was amazing. It was a really added value experience, the service was so personalised, we even had our own butler, Isuru, who would help us any time with anything we wanted. The food in all restaurants of the hotel was really good and we would definitely recommend to go for the half board. Really environmental friendly, respecting the animal life and nature. I would definitely recommend it and would certainly go back. Nothing, everything was perfect!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Their butler service for Private Villa is excellent. Our private butler ""Shafni"" was excellent and her went out of the way to help us when we had misplaced one of our laptop bags 2 hours drive away from our hotel. He did everything possible to successfully get it back to us. We would have been happier if there were some live music events happening in the property as there were not many places nearby the resort to wine and dine with music. Any kind of musical nights would make the evenings more bright in the property"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything. Amazing facilities, beach, staff, pool, restaurant... The ‘extra’ activities and SPA were way too expensive. The restaurant and drinks too, but the 2 fine dining restaurants are worth every penny!"

It was a nice compensation for the big waves on the beach which were spectacular but making a swim in the ocean quite impossible. The atmosphere was relaxing and room facilities were very good. We have stayed at places like this before but for much lower price. Our personal buttler was out of reach during our stay, therefore we had to call reception for everything, which is ok they were helpfull I just don’t get it why have a service so not usefull..."

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"The location, rooms, food and ambience are wonderful but all this is only possible because of the amazing management and staff at Anantara in Tangalle. They make personalized service a reality and their warmth as well as their consummate professionalism meant our stay over Christmas 2018 was memorable at every level. This is an expensive hotel but a wonderful example of what a five star hotel should be.
Thanks to all who made our Christmas special. The Brussels sprouts served on Christmas Eve at the most amazing buffet I have ever experienced were slightly under cooked. 😂 .......seriously everything else was perfection."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"absolutely everything. we were greeted with flowers and a music performance. the property is wonderful right at the beach. the waves are very strong which makes it a bit difficult to swim but the beach with the palm trees and stones in the water is breathtaking. the pool is one of the best I’ve seen so far. 
And the service is absolutely outstanding. During the day they walk around the pool with homemade papaya ice cream/ water and they fulfill every wish you have. I have travelled a lot and seen a lot of beautiful hotels and beaches. Anantara is definitely one of the best!! nothing!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was Amazing! From the moment we step foot inside to the time we left... the welcome, the villa, the service, the food,
The pools... AMAZING!  If I had to find something I didn’t like, it would
Be that the beach is not swimmable... but 20meters across is a great beach.
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,The hotel was fantastic. The staff were so courteous and incredibly helpful. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful. They have all the facilities you might need for your stay in an incredibly relaxing environment. Thank you so much. Nothing
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was beyond our expectations.isuru,our personal butler went out of his way to make us feel at home!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Pool area, restaurant location, layout, breakfast, sunsets. Tuna tataki! Only minor drawback is beach is not very safe for swimming. Despite notices about this, all beach sun beds get occupied even though there are no people to be seen"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.5 ,Ant infestation in blacony and lobby
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything from the room host whatsapp service to the food and the atmosphere . Lovely all over The room floor was a bit dusty
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Beautiful luxury ! We loved our stay The food was overpriced and not up to high standard which you’d expect for the high prices.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"This property is awesome.
We were welcomed in a special Sri Lankan way with drums and flowers. It was so damn beautiful.
Our rooms were very good 
The food at the restaurant, specially chef Deepak went out of his way to make our meal special. We are travelling with an infant and needed special food which he went out of his way and did a fantastic job
Our room host Pasan was really good.
He arranged everything for us,
From room cleaning to table reservations.
He managed everything for us. 
Anantara have a lovely pool , entertainment,
Child play area, greenery , beach ... can’t ask for more... 
They have peacocks , ducks , roosters , 
Monkeys in the property .
Its so pretty .... 
I loved this property and the hospitality, would definitely visit again 
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Very beautiful property, very attentive staff, great food. Food&drinks are reasonably priced. Airport transfer offered by the hotel is grossly overpriced, better book something externally."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything was perfect from the welcome drums to the goodbye prayers. We loved the attention to detail and the small things like an ice lolly handed out by the pool. Facilities were 5* and the staff were even more so. The food was incredible and the selection second to none. Don’t stay anywhere else!
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Everything (food, room, spa, kids’ club) was excellent!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,"Great hotel, great breakfast etc. No swimming on the beach and they call it a beach resort :("
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Stayed for our honeymoon. It was absolutely wonderful. The best hotel we have ever stayed in. The pool, beach, staff, food, grounds are all amazing. We went on the nature walk run by Eddie which was great (saw monkeys, giant squirrel and peacocks). We played tennis, badminton, table tennis, pool, used the gym; all the facilities are high quality. We went to the spa on our last day and got an hour long massage which was amazing; would recommend getting there early to go in the steam room before the massage; very relaxing. The staff are so attentive and cannot do enough for you. They are so friendly and will go out of your way to make your stay a memorable one. Would stay again!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,Paradise in earth... Nothing :)
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Everything was top notch  Was a looooong way from the airport (5+ hours)
My ‘ocean view room’ was of palm trees (couldn’t see the ocean at all, although it was technically there as I could hear it....there was absolutely no view though). By the time I got there/ traveled all the way I couldn’t be bothered complaining so my own fault, really. 
They have a kind of wine room/ tapas bar there, but the wines are pretty much the same as the other bars there. So not sure why they bothered? But the food was amazing, regardless. 
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,HEAVEN PARADISE Price offers for taxi and tours about 3-5 times higher than local offers... same for surf lessons...
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"extremely good there was no live music, it could be easily organized evening in pool restaurant to dance etc.."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,The staff go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The property is located in a stunning location overlooking a beautiful
beach. The hotel grounds are wonderful, there is so much wildlife around
you and it’s so lushing great and well maintained. We had such a warm
welcome and departure from all the staff members. All restaurants serve
delicious food and service is so friendly and professional. We had a
very romantic meal in the Italian a la carte restaurant. All three
courses were very tasty and wine was very good too. The Asian restaurant
has got a beautiful setting too. We were so lucky to have breakfast
there every morning, enjoying our fresh juices and scrumptious a la
carte breakfast. We also dined there at lunchtime and in the evening,
always getting delicious meals and fantastic service. The buffet
restaurant had an excellent variety of choice and great quality food
too. Again, service was spot on. We only stayed for 4 nights, wish we
had booked a longer stay, if only we knew it was going to be so amazing.
The pictures don’t do this place justice, you really have to be there to
appreciate Anantara experience. We were so lucky to get upgraded to a
private villa with a plunge pool. Apparently someone had cancelled last
minute. The villa was absolutely gorgeous and we are so grateful we had
a chance to stay there. We had our butler Piyal, not something we are
used to, but he was fantastic, always at our service, so pleasant and
genuine, always making sure we had everything we needed. We loved our
stay so much that we’re already thinking of going back in the future.
Couldn’t recommend Anantara more. We’ve stayed in many other chain
hotels before, but Anantara proved to be something really special. It
made a fantastic start of our honeymoon. Thank you to all the staff.
 Nothing really, but a couple of thing we could mention were the seats in
the Asian restaurant - they should have some cushions as they are not
the most comfortable to sit for a long period of time. The minibar
prices could definitely be lower as well.
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,It was an amazing experience overall. This place is PERFECT for families with kids. Everyone who works there is super nice and friendly Nothing
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Staff were very helpful and there were lovely touches in how they greeted you and daily rituals which added something to the stayWe had buffet evening meals which were  goodBeach was lovely and we had a ground floor access room which did not have a view but this was made up by the easy access to the beach which was just across the lawnWe organised a private tour on way back to Colombo and driver and what we visited was excellent It is along way and long drive from airport"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Great staff Restaurants expensive
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"That out if this world welcome! Being Sri Lankans ourselves, felt right at home. Their attention to smaller details is remarkable. Nothing that stands out"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"We had an excellent stay over 7 nights at this great hotel with very good service and food. Thank you very much. 
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Breakfast spread varied, Amazing staff, they will do anything to make sure your stay is comfortable. Most of all loved the chipmunks and various birds that greeted us every morning. The pool and beach service where also impeccable and the interiors where amazing. No complaints! Would come back again and again"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,Everything apart from the in-house prices charged for drinks and food Prices for in house drinks and food very expensive and it was unfortunate that during our two day stay the pool was taken over by noisy families and children and all their toys - duck rings etc.  . . Shame the children don’t have their own pool at this supposed ’peace’ hotel!!
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"The hotel location is wonderful, secluded and cosy with great sea views. The facilities and amenities were good. There were many things to do and see, from padding fields to peacocks and baby-foot, table tennis and billiard. The staff were amazing, very helpful and flexible. Our host Pasan demonstrated excellent customer service and constantly communicated with us through whatsapp throughout our stay at the hotel. Staff were attentive, they organized my son's birthday cake and signed off a ""Get Well Soon"" card for my elder son who had a severe sun burn. Restaurants had good food and service, the breakfast buffet was very good. If we were to visit Sri Lanka again definitely we would stay at this hotel. The kids' club could have been better and music, special nights at the restaurants in the evenings would have made a better atmosphere."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Beautiful grounds and villa.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"fantastic location, staff and breakfast. Buffet dinner amazing too. Short drive to surf breaks"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Isuru was very helpful
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"A very good beach - the best I have ever seen!!!! Waves - at the beginning seem too large but a little bit later you get to know how to swim at them and it is a great fun to swim at such a ocean!!!!Kitchen - excellent! Room - very comfortable.Wild animals at the territory of the hotel! Juices and water could be free at dinner."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Excellent service. Our personalized butler, Kanishka made sure we optimally allocated time. The villa was extremely well sought out. All the touch points have been carefully crafted - kudos to the architect and design team.Gorgeous garden.  Probably the best beach in the South Coast. Really can't think of anything. Maybe breakfast could improve in terms of flavor for my taste."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Great hotel. Great staff!!! None
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"We are in love with this beautiful hotel.. The staff was so nice and the whole resort is so stunning!For sure we will come back! ❤️ As we said, we liked everything.. only it is a bit expensive.."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Extremely kind , Duo to our flight we arrived at hotel in the morning at 10am, but they still let us check in shortly to take rest after long road trip. We stay for 3nights , everything is perfect, the facilities are super humanized , The hotel environment very beautiful , all the greens around us , There are peacocks walking leisurely on the grass just like us . I love this place . Peaceful and relaxing. The best experience I ever had .Big Thanks to all the staffs , for them smiles and professional ."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"We spend two nights at Anantara. I can capture this place in one word: amazing. I've seen and been to many places around the globe and although I normally ain't the guy who really likes resorts - I'm more a boutique hotel kinda person - but this place just has is all. It definitely has a spot in 'my all time favourite places I've ever stayed list'.The room we had (311) was wonderful. I loved the bath. The beach is clean and private. There are quite many beach chair spots for couples near the pool and along the beach where you can chill privately with your partner. The swimming pool is nice, especially the one below as there are usually not many kids. (they tend to use the upper pool). Their breakfast is brilliant: fresh juices, salmon, brie cheese, noodle soup, fruit and so much more. We had dinner in the Asian restaurant twice and both nights the food was delicious. The service of the staff is out of this world. They are really helpful. Two examples. One night a bottle of water made out of glass fell onto the bathroom floor. After we informed the staff they immediately send someone over to clean up the pieces of broken glass. Another example was that once I left the hotel and was already in my other hotel in Weligama 40 km further away, I realized I had forgotten my Lacoste polo, so I send a sms text to Anantara. They made sure I got my polo back the next day by giving it to our driver. A big shout out to Sayuri for her help.All in all I can really recommend this place; you won't regret it! Thanks Anantara for the very very pleasant stay!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,All of it Nothing
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Incredible place to stay! The hotel and facilities are simply amazing! The staff went above and beyond and restaurants were fantastic! It’s also a great base to explore surrounding Tangalle. Some areas of the grounds, e.g. the lower pool area need a little work to improve."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Amazing food friendly staff A bit too far from the city
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Big rooms, lovely view and beach. Very good breakfast, nice property overall. Personnel should be trained better. Above the general level of Sri Lanka but below the western level."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Wow!! Anantara absolutely blew my husband and I away. From the very moment we arrived the service was just so personable!! The room we had was spacious and a gorgeous view of the sea/ pool. The food at the restaurants were always delicious. The pool/gym/tennis court were all excellent! Would come back here in a heartbeat. It was the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in. Nothing!
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was superb! From the moment we were picked up in Ella to our departure drop off in Colombo, this Anantara resort has exceeded our expectations! The staff, the location, the food, the beach, the ambience, we enjoyed all our stay and will definitely try to return one day! That we couldn’t stay longer!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"FoodService Facilities Quite pricey"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"The peacefulness, the grounds, beautiful breakfasts, modern facilities and  the view of the sea from our room.  I had a most comfortable sleep. The beach has a very strong undertow.  The waves were extremely large and strong and the sea drops off very quickly.  It was very dangerous for swimming.   There are warning signs on the beach. The pool temperature was too warm for a refreshing swim."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,"The pool bar staff and Uppul were really friendly and always remembered our names. Uppul always took care of us and came to say hello everytime he saw us. As we were on our honeymoon, we had a private dinner on the beach which was just perfect."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Beautiful villa, beautiful location, friendly staff, great food, amazing beach. The service was sometimes a little over-zealous"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The hotel resort feels fantastic in every way! Design, comfort, cleanliness, ambience of the whole place plus very well trained & all-the-time smily staff make it a true paradise on earth! Our beach access room was stylish, spacious, comfortable and super clean! Unique towel animals made for us everyday after cleaning by housekeeping:) Food was fresh, delicious cooked and we really enjoyed themed dinner nights at the main buffet - Sri Lankan nights were TOP! Service at the hotel is amazing, they truly go the extra mile to make tou feel welcome, appreciated and keep you comfortable at all times. Thank you Rohan, Jeeva, Krishan and all other members of staff:) "

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,The staff are friendly and the villa we stayed at is beyond amazing.I will definitely come back 
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Great property in a beautiful location. Friendly staff and excellent food and drink. Spacious rooms well fitted. Tours to local attractions are slightly overpriced.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything was perfect from the minute I walked in. It was the perfect escape and the staff were incredibly helpful. The food was great and the villa had everything you could need. Honestly one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in for a long time. It was also perfect for a solo traveller - I honestly didn’t want to leave the hotel 
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Thank you for the nice stay! Hotel is beautiful, staff is very friendly, everything is clean and food was very tasty!
And of course ocean and nature are just amazing!
 Far from the airport (4,5 h drive)"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,The Hospitality is the best.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 7.9 ,My selection was good for room because the villa was perfect. I order some food and they brought almost after 45 min. Order was burger for kids.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The resort is much more beautiful than the pictures give away. Incredibly lush and serene resort, we didnt leave the property during our 5 night stay...  Recommended! The food quality for dinners at the restaurants was inconsistent."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"It was so beautiful and amazing, honestly can’t get over it, literally everything was perfect."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.3 ,"Spa service, special dinners, palm trees Occasional staff inattentive such as seats by the water not being able to get towels, waiting to get initial service when staff did not seem busy, ex. Ordering water."

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,I have already post my review as we stayed 3 nights and then extended one more. Everything is excellent and beyond! Nothing.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"This place is really a piece of heaven. We need some days to rest after 2 weeks visiting and travelling through the rest of the country. The last week in Sri Lanka we split between Tangalle, Mirissa and Galle. Initially we thought we will stay only 3 nights here but we booked an extra night and still we did not want to leave at all. But we had to stick to our plans although when we arrived in Mirissa ( don’t worry Mirissa is lovely too) we were thinking to coming back for 3 more nights. That much we liked it here. Everything was exceptional: services, beautiful comfortable big rooms, infinity pools, tasty breakfast with plenty of choices and excellent facilities. We swam, played table tennis, court tennis and used the gym, too. No matter where you are the views are to die for. The hotel is in the middle of a little oasis full of trees, palm trees and wildlife with exit to the Indian ocean beach with golden white sands and shadow from tall coconut trees. 
Also we were given early check in/ late check out. That was very welcomed. Everything was perfect. Just a few remarks for other visitors. The staff is very willingly to please you and make sure you get best experience. Sometimes it may feel a little bit too much but we met exactly the same behavior at all our accommodations in Sri Lanka and figured out that it is more like a tradition when they have guests. It is a way to express hospitality. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"First when we arrived we had a warm welcoming. The check-in process did not take more than 3 minutes. We had a nice hotel tour with Mr. Yohan who really covered the small details, he even gave us Bose speaker so we can use it during our stay. The hotel facilities were very well maintained. We stayed in a garden view villa which had a private swimming pool. Everything concerns the villa was perfectly made & Also it was very clean. Staff were very well trained and they were so nice with us and with the other guests. If you are looking for a luxurious & relaxing 5 star hotel in Sri Lanka, this the place you want to be. I think it would be nicer if there was some lights facing the ocean at night. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,Was great It’s 4 hrs from Colombo 
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Located in beautiful gardens next to the beach the hotel was very well maintained.  You are allocated your very own butler on arrival who offers to drive you around the resort in a tuk tuk.  Fabulous spa with reasonably priced treatments. Staff training was excellent.  Lovely pool area. All in all a fabulous week.  The hotel advertised 6 dining options however only 2 were actually open and of these only 1 was open each evening.  Because of this the choice was very limited especially for a vegetarian. 
Whilst not the fault of the hotel the distance from the International airport means transfer time is very long. Took almost 6 hours on the way to the hotel due to the rain. Returning took 4 1/2 hours with clear conditions. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,The spa treatment and facilities were some of the best I have experienced! The pool area was beautiful and the room perfect to relax in.
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything  Nothing
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Excellent service. Great food. Friendly staff Nothing to report
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,"Luxurious. Perfectly maintained. Pristine. Right on the ocean with direct access to private beach. Tastefully furnished rooms with relaxing balconies looking onto ocean.  Food was good but nothing amazing. Overpriced compared to all the other places of similar category we’ve been to in sri lanka. Pool bar food was of very poor quality. Staff were sometimes over-eager, constantly offering us services and enquiring about our activities, which was a bit overwhelming. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,Great location on the beach. Our room looked straight out to the ocean  The staff are very friendly and welcoming.  The only criticism would be the prices of the food and drinks. A scoop of ice cream was around $9-$10 AUD which is crazy. The cocktails were also very expensive.  
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Anantara was an absolute treat to arrive to after 9 days of travel. Felt absolutely relaxed during the stay. The building is set in a beautiful location looking out over a private beach. The room was perfect with everything you could need. The service was seamless with our hostess Sayuri able to be contacted via WhatsApp for any queries or bookings at any time.  Nothing! 
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything perfect  Nothing everything was perfect 
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"An excellent decision to splurge! Highly recommend the breakfast/dinner package if it’s available- great food and it meant I didn’t have to think about anything for the 2 days I was there! Also highly recommend the spa. Some classic 5-star weird things; like water is free at breakfast but not at dinner, but a small price to pay for such a beautiful holiday."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Anantara Peace Haven Resort in Tangalle is everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel.The resort itself was beautiful with so much natural wildlife and plants that you felt like you were in the Sri Lankan jungle. We were lucky to have booked a green villa with private pool, which was superb as it gave the right amount of privacy. The butler, Kanishka, was wonderful and always available to answer any queries/requests we may have. The resort offered a variety of activities such as a beautiful spa, recreation center, public pool and beach. The two restaurants offered either italian or asian cuisines and both were super.The concierge arranged a safari tour of Yala National Park (which we highly recommend) and our butler was kind enough to make sure we had a bite to eat along the way.All in all, our experience was fantastic!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"The staff was so friendly and nice, the resort was peaceful and AMAZING! 
il Mare restaurant was so delicious I highly recommend it  Verel restaurant has a great vibe but the food wasn’t that good "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything about my experience at the hotel was amazing. Staff is friendly, food is great, facilities are very well kept and beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Sri Lanka who is looking for some luxury relaxation time."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Staff were fantastic especially our room host Shanakya, everything we needed was taken care of with minimum of fuss! Food was also superb, especially the breakfast. Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any traveler.  Nothing"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The amazing view from the luxury bedroom, the exquisite service of the staff, highly professional and kind, ready to satisfy any request.
Once you arrived a typical welcoming ritual is waiting for you, and you are followed by a personal concierge during all the staying.
The food at the buffet is delicious, higher than standard "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"As per previous reviews I read, this place is amazing. So relaxing and all you can hear are the crashing sounds of the waves which drown out all unwanted sounds (i.e. sound of children in the pool!). The view from our hotel room was amazing and I could have spent all day looking out at the sea. The nature walk with the hotel’s nature expert was super interesting, even for the children. We were even invited to a rice planting ceremony! The staff are all incredible and the restaurant food exceptionally good for both breakfast and dinner. Drinking water in glass bottles was provided for free everywhere in the resort and even sun cream was provided by each deckchair. Surprise activities were provided on rainy days (it was monsoon season). On our second before last day, we had an accident in our room at night (children playing!) and I couldn’t imagine a better response from any hotel. They whisked my husband and son off to a nearby hospital to get our son’s head checked and were so thoughtful to call me in my room (I had to stay with our toddler) to give me updates. They even covered the hospital bill! Exceptional care and service in every way. I loved everything, but if we hadn’t had the half board offer included in our 7 night stay, we would have found the food very expensive, though the quality is indeed fantastic. The pool bar was quite expensive for lunch, but we ate so much at breakfast and dinner, so we didn’t have to order much for lunch - just for the kids."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,The staff - especially our host Madu and the driver Dinnish - was really special to us. We had a birthday at the hotel and Madu did everything to make it perfect. + 10 people made a birthday card and they sang a song and they decorated the room with flowers and everything - so nice! Dinnish got up in the middle of the night to drive us to the local hospital to get medicine to an infection. He did everything in his power to help.  If you want alcoholic drinks - do not go there in Binara full moon poya day. They do not serve it (but you can find wine in the minibar in the room). 
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Forthcoming and very friendly staff

anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"We had such a great, peaceful holiday at Anantara. We were treated like royals, the service in this hotel is beyond excellent, and the guest relation manager is very professional and good at her job. We had a villa with a pool (highly recommended) which comes with its own butler. You feel at one with nature here, walking up to peacocks knocking at the window, and there were monkeys on our roof from time to time, the resort is built in perfect harmony with nature. The breakfast was the highlight of the day, and the spa is also really wonderful. The resort is big so you can have a nice walk, with several restaurants (the Japanese one was our favourite). There are also gym/yoga classes every day. We had our honeymoon/baby moon here, which this place was perfect for. Thank you Anantara for the lovely stay.  Nothing"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Excellent staff and hotel. Definitely exceeded our expectations!! Welcoming & goodbye ceremony is lovely, rooms are clean, light, spacious and nicely decorated. Hotel well-maintained, beautiful location at the shore and has many facilities. Big infinity pool with great towel service. Food & drinks at the pool are wonderful and fair-priced. We also had diner at Il Mare, the Italian restaurant which was delicious!"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"This hotel is the meaning of the world beach vacation 
Its very good and the rooms are very BIG the staff is very professional and want to help you in every way possible 
My host Isuru was the best he even kept in touch until i reached my other destination  The pool bar is bit expensive.
The shisha lounge is fairly priced 
The fact the Half board means that i only get 35$ per person was not stated when i was booking ! So that wasn’t great
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The service, the rooms, breakfast The beach was nor accessible due to the winds"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.0 ,"The location is beautiful , the staff were amazing, yoga in the morning is beneficial the food was fantastic . There are nature walks and other interesting indigenous experiences  The properties main beach has a strong current. There is a public beach next door but it’s not luxury and you will get hassled by hawkers. The beach would be much better enjoyed if there were a number of lifeguards and some flippers, flotation devices for guests to use and wear to feel safe in the water "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,"Comfortable room and very pleasant staff Hotel beach not suitable for swimming
"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"We were upgraded to the villa with ocean view. The staff are super friendly with a smile. From the moment we arrived until we left they made our stay super special. Excellent food, service, nice pool, amazing views on the beach. Lots of wildlife. Can’t fault it at all"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Cleanliness: the room gets cleaned twice a day. In addition, staff are spread throughout the resort cleaning all day long  which made the entire place spotless.
Remarkable Staff
Everyone (EVERYONE) is smiling, greeting, and offering help all the time. 
Nevertheless, I would like to mention few names that made our stay a memorable one:
Syuri, our personal assistant. she was in direct/continuous contact with us through Whatsapp. She would greet us every morning on breakfast, and offers her help. She has made several arrangements for us either within the resort or outside it. We were satisfied with her services for sure.
Hasini: She arranged a special occasion for us on the beach, she was so nice and helpful. She went beyond our expectations, and she was (happy) to serve us and that meant a lot to us.
Thameena: An excellent Chef with a friendly smile. One of our favorite moments while having breakfast, is when she approaches us with a basket of freshly cooked croissants . She also would suggest plates that suit our dietary preferences which is something we appreciated.
Yoga: I truly enjoyed my early morning Yoga class, it was set on a place with a Breathtaking view.... It was for sure something to remember.  -At night the place becomes albite down. It would be great if they arrange something for entertainment at night; Live show, Outdoor Cinema, Reading classes, evening Yoga meditation....etc
-A luxurious resort should have variety of restaurants to choose from, however, during our stay only the main restaurant was working everyday, where the other two restaurants we working on alternative days (every day one of them only serves dinner)"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"The breakfast was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the chilled coconut water served at the reception area. All the staff was very courteous. Would like to especially thank Sayuri, guest relation officer who went out of her way to make our stay memorable. She looked into all our requests and gave personalised attention to all our needs. Would have preferred more dining options and a little entertainment in the evening"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Absolutely amazing. 
The location and setting is just beautiful. 
I have been to many beautiful hotels around the world and this is definitely amongst one of my absolute favorites. 
Beautiful palm trees, wonderful ocean views, secluded beach, great pool, relaxing spa. Great service in all areas. 
Everything is perfect! 
Best guest relations experience. Many thanks to Pasan! 
I can fully and totally recommend this resort.  Absolutely nothing to complain!!! "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Had a wonderful stay at this lovely resort. Got a villa with the pool and 24/7 butler Piyal who is absolutely highlight of my stay. This place is full of fun facilities and activities (surfing, cooking class, yoga, gym, ecological park, spa) with many nice restaurants. The morning meditation, freshly made breakfast with gorgeous sea view is the best way to start my day. The staffs here were so helpful and caring. Highly recommend the service at this hotel and I’ll deff choose to stay here again Nothing to complain. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"The location is stunning, beautiful beach and lovely garden. You do feel like you're in paradise.
It is worthwhile to choose the Ocean View room and enjoy the great view.
The rooms are nicely decorated, very spacious and clean and you can even watch the waves crush from your bathtub :)
Nice and fast check in / check out process, you get all the info you need. 
Everyone at the hotel is very nice and welcoming, trying to make your stay as nice as possible.
My hostesses, Sayuri, was extremely nice and helpful, always there for any questions or support.
I thoroughly enjoyed the garden tour by the hotel naturalist, Sudheera, that I found very informative and interesting, so recommended.
Nice Yoga classes with a view. 
Breakfast is great, lovely pool area and service.
Everything is clean and well maintained.  1. The services were very expensive. I understand it is a 5 stars exclusive hotel but perhaps the strategy can be revised and more guests would consume more and be happier. $ 135 for the spa treatment or $ 75 for a one course + desert for one person is pretty pricey...
2. Everyone in the hotel is very nice and helpful but sometimes it can be a bit too much. You are asked at least 5 times if you like the food or if you want coffee, etc. Sometimes you prefer to just enjoy without being interrupted that often. So just look for the right balance in terms of customer service.
3. I would've liked to have a bar by the beach. Perhaps that was not available due to the off season? ...
4. The pool should be opened later than 18.30 since there are no other activities to be done (other than eat and drink) after this hour.
5. There was some refurbishing activity going on right next to the pool. I did  not mind that as I preferred to spend the time by the ocean but this information should've been made available prior to booking as it can be disturbing "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"With lovely surprises at every corner our stay at Anantara was a pleasurable perfect experience and I must thank the entire Anantara team during our stay. 
I can’t speak of the team without mentioning Sayuri  whose attention to detail attentiveness and kindness made our stay very special.  
Mr and mrs Alrushodi Nothing"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything! The place comes with a great service, high quality of food, drinks and spirits and lovely staff!!Several reviews say that their spa/restaurant prices are ridiculous. Yes, their prices are higher but for a good reason. The spa has the most beautiful set-up and vibe you can imagine. Architecture is great and their staff goes beyond to make you feel extraordinary (not mentioning that the massages and facials are really, really good!). Also the food in their restaurants: Il Mare and Verala is great and worth every penny! It is the best place in Sri Lanka so far and we highly recommend it.Also our host - Shafni - was absolutely great! Their buffet restaurant is just OK - nothing mind blowing but thats somehow expected."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.0 ,"The pool area was great, the teppanyaki was incredible!  Service from all the staff was amazing. If you want a VERY big resort with all the mod cons this is the place. A tad characterless but that’s what you get at the big resorts. I will say it was very clean and tidy everywhere. One thing to note, neither of the 2 restaurants open until 7pm?? Very strange to be missing out on the sunsets with a Pre dinner cocktail. The lunch options were not a great variety? Dinner was extremely expensive in both restaurants. We had Teppanyaki one night and although amazing, we had lobster and prawn, it was nearly AUD $300-!! for 2 plus one small child. The room service medium price was AUD $25- per option (club sandwich) Jeeva who served us for afternoon tea was an incredibly sweet man who was a lovely chai walla."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Very comfortable and a wonderful team of professionals whatever there job
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.0 ,"The staff were all lovely, couldn't be more helpful. The WhatsApp facility to contact was brilliant, it meant we didn't miss out on any events and could contact Rohan easily. The food was excellent we had buffet, room service and ate at verele, all were fantastic. We walked in the grounds alot, the wildlife information, the beautiful grounds and the abundance of animals kept our children amused for hours, truly great. We found the children's club very dissapointing. We went every day, sometimes multiple times for short periods. Each time we went we were the only people in there however little to no effort was made to interact with the children, no activities were offered or running (despite the board outside advertising a time table), absolutely all of the toys were very old, used and almost all were broken in some way. The colouring books were all full, no pages left to colour. The only other child we ever saw in there was a little girl who had coloured a picture and asked if she could take it home and was told no, the fully coloured picture had to stay. No books, crafts, activities of any sort were offered, we just played with the same ball, car and teddies that were left on the floor of the room. Also the English of the children's club assistants was surprisingly limited, especially in comparison to every other member of staff we interacted with at the hotel. This meant it was very difficult for the children to understand or converse with them. The assistants just stood around and watched mainly, making us feel like they would prefer if we left. In the end we just stayed in our room and played with the limited toys we had brought or walked around the grounds and spotted the wildlife instead. It was absolutely awful in comparison to many kids clubs we have experienced in other hotels. Also on a lesser note, the kids pool is in the middle of the pool bar which means that when the kids were playing the guests eating their lunch at the bar were getting annoyed with the children (our children are only 18 months and 6 months so mainly just sitting and tottering about not being boisterous), a bizzare set up."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 8.0 ,"Italian restaurant was fantastic. Great food, with superb fresh ingredients.A performance to produce italian flavor in tropical environement. :-) and good to have a break from SLK food for once Too expensive, both for the room and for services. 150USD for the spa is cray !"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Great location and facilities. Shisha was good. Bed was noisy and squeaking
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Very beautiful. Perfect pool very good staff and nice beach. Rooms are a bit spread out.

The staff here had world class customer service, we loved everyone we had the chance to talk to, so friendly and so helpful. The restaurants are incredible too! We will definitely be back! Can not recommend this place high enough!! Keep in mind the food here / spa treatments are very expensive (but worth it!)"
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.0 ,"Well-kept hotel with very friendly staff. My daughter had lost her swimming goggles - they were found and brought to the next hotel!
The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The food in the main restaurant is very varied and tastes great! Extra mashed potatoes and co. were prepared for our baby."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"A really beautiful property. Set without gorgeous surrounds and a beautiful beach. By no means small or boutique, but friendly and with some wonderful onsite restaurants. We stayed in a private villa with beach view. One massive bonus of this was its south facing aspect - we had sunlight all day long! Generally, no complaints other than the below....  Value for money - I’m afraid to say, that as much as we absolutely loved it, it was overpriced and therefore can’t fully recommend as there may be better value for money out there. "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Easy access to the ocean, excellent food Expensive incidentals "
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The team was amazing and created a memorable experience. We created connections with many of them - Sayurl, Upul, Krishan and Suresh to name a few. The Journey's team is a special crew. Their level of attentiveness was unbelievable and constantly looking for opportunities to help and make sure we were relaxing and having a wonderful stay. They made our time there so special and we're still talking about them. The view from our room was spectacular.  We had a Premier Ocean View Room. If you can, I would highly recommend one of them. We were sad to leave."
anantara-tangalle-peace-haven-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The service was top notch with a keen attention to detail.

pegasus-reef, 10 ,Nice overral! The A/C in the room!
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,Located out of the busy hustle and bustle of the city. Quiet and relaxed. Beautiful fish restaurant on site. Staff couldn’t have been more helpful if they tried.  WiFi wasn’t great in the rooms. However wasn’t a big deal 
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,Quick and Efficient Service Friendly Staff Clean Room Delicious Food The pool
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"Rooms, view from balcony. Lighting, check in experience, very helpful staff, lobby"
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Welcome drinks on arrival.
They didn't charge the US$35 as advertised for an airport drop-off instead they ordered us a taxi and we paid Lkr 1200. 
Offered us a later checkout as we had an evening flight which was nice. Location was really far out from the city and far away from the airport  and we had difficulty getting a tuk tuk driver to know where to go, he rang the hotel in the end for directions. 
Advertised as a beach side hotel and while it is you cant swim on the water and the beach is covered in rubbish which I noted from other reviews so the issue isn't being addressed. The hotel is overstaffed with 8 people behind the reception at one point which was intimidating and needless. 
The bathroom in the room was grubby and not very clean.
There is a compulsory service charge on food and drink.
The pictures used to advertise the hotel make it look alot nicer than it is.
It's outdated and needs some TLC.
I expected more for the money compared to other much cheaper and centrally located hotels in Colombo.
"
pegasus-reef, 5.4 ,"Excellent food, friendly staff, very clean.Premila Samarakoon (front office manager) was especially helpful in resolving certain issues encountered.If you wish to eat at the hotels sea food restaurant ask for Jagath Bandarigodage (Restaurant & Bar Manager), extremely friendly and helpful person - many thanks for all the advice given The hotel is still recovering after tsunami and still has a way to go.On the web site they state that airport shuttle is available - this is incorrect. Instead they use a 'VIP' taxi service that charges 3 time the normal taxi rate. At reception on arrival you are charged for the duration of your stay with extortionate tax added (nearly double price quoted) - Why not display the full price on the site? From stepping out of the airport you- get the feeling of being scammed - not a nice feeling!Tips:- Use Uber to arrange transport, you can use the price quoted to 'haggle' with Tuk Tuk's etc- Do not charge things to the hotel room, pay in cash, will save a LOT OF HASSLE during checkout"
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"Friendly staff, clean and nice rooms and an excellent breakfast. We ate dinner at the Fisherys which was really delicious and the waiter cared a lot about us. "
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Room was super good, since we were in a family suite. All the facilities in the room was excellent and amazingly arranged. The entrance of the hotel and the lobby area of the hotel is good, Fisheries restaurant, swimming pool next to trees amazing and finally the lawn. Staff of the hotel need a development of professional practice which is far more below the average. If you selecting this property as your next travel location to relax, I would like to recommend to avoid this place. Forget about the hospitality, at least the minimum job of the staff still needs to develop when it comes to make the process is smooth. Restaurant was always occupied with the groups where in house guests were ill treated.  Food in the main restaurant need to enhance more in the quality of the food, therefore, If someone looking to go this property I would like to recommend go for BB or room only to make sure your money is not getting wasted. To make sure their turnover, they have given the space of the hotel (Lawn, pool area, beach area) to a day outing group which was a mess and hell of disturbance for our quality stay."
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,Range of food for breakfast very good. The bed very comfortable So many flies all over the food. I only took cooked food that had cover on it. Reception only half hearted in helping arrange transport into City. were not forth coming with information about how to get around Colombo. Got the impression they only wanted to push expensive options.

pegasus-reef, 2.9 ,"I dont have anything good to say about this hotel , very disappointed. Everything , specially the fake upgrade"
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"If I could give Pegasus Reef Hotel 100 stars, then i did it.I have been to Pegasus Reef Resort over several times in a short period of time. From the first time I entered the door the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. When I had messed up in a booking, they found a solution. Since I could not leave Sri Lanka as planned, visa problems, everyone was ready to help me out of that situation. All the time with warm smile. Not only at the front desk  but the waiters in the lovely restaurantes and the rest of the staff were so sweet. It was not a friendliness that grew from the fact that I was a tourist and had US $ but from there hearts. Thank you to everyone at PRR, Hope to see you again. Special thanks to Mr. Shaun my problem-solutioner all the best to you. I could be nice if the beach was clean from plastik and other things."

pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,Food is very tasty. Lots of variety for breakfast and dinner buffet . Its value for money. Great place with excellent and cooperative  staff  .Very clean hotel . Spacious and Grand look. Beach is just at the backside of the hotel . Value for money !! Well nothing to mention. Just its a bit far from airport otherwise best place to stay.

pegasus-reef, 10 ,The festive spirit and the beautiful lighting and decoration on Christmas eve! We also ordered in-room lunch and it was served hot and tasted great.

pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,"food,personnel dirty swimming pool,garbage on the beach,prohibited swimming on the hotel beach (?!)"
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,"This was our first stay in Sri Lanka in 40 years, hotel was OK, as long as you do not expect Asian hotel level.Overall a nice hotel. Much nicer and more smiles than India, Less nice and less smiles than Thailand. Beach was not clean, plastic bags and containers every where on the beach."

pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"The staff was extremely helpful, kind and accommodating. We would definitely go back."
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,It has a great view and good and everything was good. Overall the room was clean and was spacious.  Though we had a pool view room it was covered with a tree and there was a bee hive in that tree so we couldn’t go to our balcony. Other than that it was good 
pegasus-reef, 10 ,All the staffs were very helpful and specially the front desk staff who made our checking.. Hotel is so clean food is amazing. We were so relaxed and surely gonna come back for a longer stay.. thanks for your excellent service  None
pegasus-reef, 4.6 ,"Staff are not good they are not helping to resolve some matters they are ignoring us..Really disappointing 😒😒 
They charged for everything if you are booking from Booking.com.
Very bad experience at Pegasus Reef Hotel"
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"We loved the entire experience at pegasus. The staff were really very helpful. We got a complimentary early check in and on request, they provided us a room with a bath tub. We were really happy and the breakfast buffet was amazing! I would highly recommend this property and we are definitely staying here again. The only thing that we didn't like here was that the property is far from the main road. Transportation is a bit difficult. We used Pickme app so it was easy. Other than that everything is excellent."
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"The breakfast buffet was filled with various varieties of food. The rooms are clean, the bed extra comfy, and the bathrooms were clean too.The property is beautiful and one can easily spend days here at a stretch. There are almost no vegetarian options at the restaurant to order separately. I had to request them to make a pasta without the meat so I could eat something other than a veg burger or a sandwich (the only 2 veg options available). However, the pasta turned out really bad.But other than the lack of vegetarian food, the hotel is great."
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,Not much Away from main road. Night time travelling to hotel is dangerous.
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,Staff is excellent Not maintained the hotel at all ! It’s a patertic to sit on the broken banquet chairs ! AC does not work in the lobby area 😡 ! So many faults everywhere
pegasus-reef, 3.8 ,Outdated. Old and like you arrived in the 70th... overpriced! Just not value for the money. Definetly NOT 4 star place!
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"sea food restaurnat and kitchen staff is amazing there !! they need to improve on there F&B services, food is great but room service + restaurnat servic staff can be better. In restaurant even Chef ahs to come to take order and clean table !!"
pegasus-reef, 3.3 ,Nothing Staff is very unfriendly n rude and the property is not a beach front property.
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,The hotel is nice and nice staff. It’s very outdated and needs a good upgrade!
pegasus-reef, 4.2 ,Staff were friendly Awful run down place... stank of mould and apparently the beach is toxic according to the staff
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,The staff was good sadly our stay was interrupted with the shortcomings at the hotel  When they checked us in the room had an AC issues and no amenities in the room even the soup we had to call and get it sent and it took about an 1hour to sort the AC issue and the room was sooo warm 
pegasus-reef, 10 ,I have been staying here for more than a decade. Rooms have been refurbished and look very modern. Breakfast as always was excellent. This location has been my all time favorite. Very quiet. Excellent 👌 Staff seems to be new. Unable to handle taxi issues. Still not received invoice of stay
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,"The pool area was lovely. Good selection at breakfast. The hotel lacks any kind of atmosphere. It seems to exist for tour groups to turn up, spend the night and leave again. The staff weren’t very friendly. Myself and my daughter were shouted at by the pool man as we were about to enter the pool without showering but we hadn’t noticed the showers as they are quite far back from the pool. You were never greeted at breakfast, your room number was just demanded. I also mentioned on booking that it was my husbands 40th birthday trip. They said they would put something in the room to mark the occasion. Nothing was there although we stayed for 2 nights and I did mention at reception but nothing was done. The instructions were even written on our check in sheet but obviously ignored. There was a lot of damp patches round the hotel and towels on the floor and it smelled of damp. It also says the hotel is ten minutes from the city centre, it took us a minimum of half an hour to drive in a taxi along awful roads."
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,We had a one night stay. The arrangements made at hotel. Definetely going back again.
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,"Nice room, great pillows, grubby polyester blanket that I wasn’t comfortable using. Bathroom ok.
Lovely seafood restaurant with nice vista.
Pool has seen better days but still pleasant spot. Felt rather out of the way and nothing around.
Basic room facilities but comfortable enough, nice balcony and felt safe. Felt rather out of the way and nothing around really to explore."
pegasus-reef, 3.8 ,The food was not tasty. The staff was not friendly. Didnt serve well during breakfast. I asked for a finger bowl and they gave me a soup bowl with water instead. Had to wait fifteen mins in ghe queue until they bring milk refill to make my tea.

pegasus-reef, 3.3 ,Only the Front Reception Desk Team Nothing
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,Facilities ok. Hotel management not sincere and honest.Hotel staff especially front desk and food service staff have very bad attitude
pegasus-reef, 2.9 ,"Only the food at the fisheries. While hosts of them.
A. The aircon in the room (320) was getting cooler. It was explained to us that the min temp is set at 24 degrees and it cannot be cooler than that. On insistence to their credit they changed the room where the aircon was working well.
B. Second room (250) still in the 90s, broken bed, broken toilet ceiling, broken sofa set, water leaking from toilet ceiling.
C. Breakfast- starts at 7am, not all counters are  ready even by 730. Had to wait for eggs for Long. The place behind the egg and the hoopers counter does not resemble a hotel of 4star. It is even worse than a 1 star. Wooden crate, garbage bin, broken display counter to name a few. 
D. Guests to note that the property provides only one door key.
The above points is for the property to improve. I booked the property by looking at the rating, however totally disappointed. Will never stay and recommend. "
pegasus-reef, 10 ,I loved the hospitality. The staff was very friendly. My man Indika at the bar was very friendly and great conversation. He even arranged a cake for my friend's birthday. Outstanding guy.  There was some construction going on in the hotel that was a bit noisy at times
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"Lovely staff, amazing pool and loved the restaurants"
pegasus-reef, 5.4 ,"Room is clean. Pool is excellent. Wifi was good. The Booking.com price and when you check in the price is totally difference. This is the first time I had this kind of issue. We booked a triple room but we got double room with extra bed. We are 3 adults and 1 adult can’t sleep in that small bunk bed. The actually room is for 2 person. All the facilities and amenities are for 2 person. The hotel is under renovation, the working people there are shouting so you get disturbed. The pool is close to renovating area all the people working there are watching at you while you are relaxing in pool. Specially they are looking at ladies. The restaurant staff had no experience. They are not attention to the details. And the buffet is small and little choices. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anybody, there are so much good hotels nearby."

pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,"Hotel on the beach  For sure this hotel is not 4 stars
Breakfast 
Old"
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,They were very nice and help ful all the staff They had a a party for 1800 people and tents every where do we could not move around freely
pegasus-reef, 4.2 ,"The lobby is big The rooms were smelly and bit suffocated
Also limited variety of vegetarian options at the restaurant
Reception staff was not very courteous "
pegasus-reef, 3.8 ,"Beach was not nearby as shown in the site Communication with guest need to be improved more, as I was informed by reception the breakfast included in my package when I was checking in, once done with braskfast I asked to pay for it .. when entering to restaurant the team was acted like I’m entitle for the free breakfast."
pegasus-reef, 4.2 ,"The hotel appears to have had better days.The buffet at breakfast wasn't great, however the Fishery restaurant was excellent!Very disappointed in the beach and also the cost online was excluding taxes and we felt without breakfast expensive"
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"Lovely hotel and staff.  Great location.  Lovely pool.Nice buffetLoved our linked room and view. Would visit againRoom facilities were very good especially the iron and ironing board facility in the wardrobe.  Fab shower too."
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,Lovely pool and we were entertained during the New Year festivities. The buffets for breakfast and evening meal were really goo with so much choice.
pegasus-reef, 2.5 ,"In general hotel is disaster Room and hotel hygiene Food in the buffet Pool is disgusting Toilet very dirty and smelly Price is different than we saw in the booking .com"
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,Breakfast was good with a lovely view.
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Staff Nothing
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"Great service, good value"
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"Very comfortable beds, staff amazingly helpful and friendly, nice clean bathrooms with good towels.  Breakfast selection was small but the food was good.
"
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Location was great. Beautiful beach. Good breakfast. Swimming pool was good for kids. No see facing rooms.
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,"Pool was lovely and the fish restaurant was nice. Stewed coffee and tea at breakfast. Late checkout charge was steep. One of our rooms was not finished - no door handles and messy.The driver arranged to take us to the airport was terrible- very risky driver"
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Staff and other amenities are really good. One can walk to beach in evening.. Enjoyed the stay..
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,"The place location, staff, and the facilities were good, and multiple breakfast options you can't consider it as a beach escape since there were no sunbeds and the beach is not clean, also the humidity smell was in the corridors and rooms, especially the lowest floors."
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"Location was best  Did not provide swimming costumes for guests who did not carry, instead asked to buy from. Inhouse shop.... That was most ridiculous thing i had ever heard from hotel. Instead they should keep 8 pairs of different sizes for both male n female guests if required. Or else should be allowed to use the cotton suits for the pool.
Secondly food was pathetic didnt liked any dinner or breakfast we had,  there was no change in either on alternate days. And main thing was only Dhal and Chawal was available for vegetarians nothing much more.... Please look into this because during my stay i observed many indians were there who were having trouble to eat except dhal n chawal.
Rest everything was good with location and beach access...its more kind of honeymoon hotel you will find more honeymooners there "
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,"Amenities, the staff was absolutely amazing.   The first room we got was smelly but the staff was nice enough to allow us to change it and our bill for the food kept on appearing and being told that we still have a bill that was paid already and when we got the bill , it was more than double, I DNT know if this is how tourists are treated but it wasnt fair"
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Beachside, relaxing Staff is very unprofessional. They came twice to my room asking for payment of breakfast, when it was already included in the rate. Upon checkout, they gave me an invoice without heading, and I had to wait 10 minutes for printing in proper letterhead. No sleepers in the room "
pegasus-reef, 10 ,What like most was the special candle light dinner that was arranged.And the staff was really friendly. Room was specious including all the facilities. Meal was the exceptional factory on my point of view. Security arrangement was satisfactory too. It's a safe place for any one stay.
pegasus-reef, 5.4 ,Fishery is really good Room service was very bad I have to Waite more than a hour for a 1 glass of milk and several times have to call for it also have to call 3 time for a general kit
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"Lovely staff, fabulous towel decorations, good food. Beach was a little dirty, it would be helpful if someone was assigned to pick up litter. The sea is dangerous and not suitable for swimming which is not within the control of the hotel."
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,"Beach Dinner is not served us So, I have spent too much finance on meals. Sorry."
pegasus-reef, 10 ,The staff super friendly and the restaurant “fishery’s “ was superb !!!
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"Location staff food service bar specially seafood restaurant amazing food breakfast staff are amazing Ac In room was not working but management try best to fix the problem
"
pegasus-reef, 3.8 ,"Only the room but the view The environment is so good.  But the staff was so unpleasant n putting various restrictions to guests. And the morning buffet was not up to the standards at all like no various foods n no table napkins n also staff was so rude cos they asked us to shift the table with foods in our hands.And main thing is we booked the hotel through booking.com price around 10,000 but we had to pay nearly 13,000 only for the room excluding VAT .That made us so uncomfortable .It would so appreciated if booking.com can fix this price floating system .Thanks"
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,"Great food, very clean, staff very welcoming. There was a large event of over 2500 people the day we arrived, which was extremely noisy all day and consisted of hundreds of drunk people on the hotel grounds before 10am. We were never told that the event was taking place and it ruined our first day at the hotel. We sought a different hotel."
pegasus-reef, 10 ,The ambience was fantastic . Specially the terrace of fishery restaurant. We had a great dinner with excellent food with the breeze from the sea Nothing. Everything was nice
pegasus-reef, 5.4 ,Location  Too much restrictions and long process 
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"Almost everything  My only comment is about the beach cleanliness , it has so much rubbish "
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"The awesome staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay and overall experience not just met our expectations but exceeded it. The pool was pristine and so was the room. We booked a half-board breakfast and dinner package. It was a romantic candle-lit dinner that was arranged on the lawn. The menu choices were excellent and food was delicious. For a snack, we ordered a crab appetizer from the Fish Restaurant which was amazing. The buffet breakfast was also one of the highlights, there was a wide selection and the manager even offered us something additional. There are also plenty of space to sit and relax. Overall excellent service and memorable experience. Thank You! Access to the beach is limited, so the only other option was to enjoy the pool at the hotel, which was great."
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,Lunch. The pool water was cloudy. The gym equipment was very old and tired.
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,I like the breakfast & restaurant atmosphere .people always with smiles. cleaness of the room is great..happy security arrange of the gate & the way they check the car
pegasus-reef, 3.3 ,"The breakfast was expensive with US$20 per person and there were flies everywhere, There was no hot water in my room and I had to call the technician twice and it was not fixed"
pegasus-reef, 5.4 ,Rooms lights are dull and not enough the room is so dark We did not get the room at first as the staff said my wife was 19 and they dont allow but she is above 18 so why cant we stay there?
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,"Room was clean.Food was good. Very laud spezielly night. Surround area Not acceptable. You can't use the beach, no bathing possible."
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Fishery restaurant and souce prepared by chef Nalaka Breakfast area, and garden has to improve."
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,On the beach side Nothing 
pegasus-reef, 5.8 ,Food was good and staff very courteous The air conditioning in the room 301 was not properly working and the room temperature was around 27 degrees which is not acceptable. Also entrance lobby had no air conditioning plus no lifts. Not disable friendly hotel!!!! Hotel was virtually empty
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"The room was clean and nice. The staff was super friendly, and our checking in and checking out happened very quickly. The food was also nice and it was a fantastic day out. Thanks."
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Comfortable room and clean bathroom with all the required facilities. Large restaurant area with a view of garden and swimming pool. Breakfast was very good with so many varieties. Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful and well maintained facility. Plenty of area for vehicle parking. Excellent stay and worth the money. Hope to go again. Nothing.
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Superb room very clean and clam. Delicious Breakfast. Good location. We had fun time.
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Everything is good
pegasus-reef, 2.5 ,Nothing Everything.
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Excellent Views! Little off site.
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Comfortable bed. There were some events/ functions going on during my stay and the guests were quite rowdy, speaking loudly along the corridor and the lobby area, loud music went on till past midnight. The rooms were small and dated; air conditions could not be adjusted . The exhaust fan in the toilet was noisy and the glass doors could not  be closed properly. The hotel’s location is remote and not easily accessible.  The roads leading to it are small and bumpy. The environment is not pleasant, many factories and warehouses around."
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,"Clean room,good meals variety and choices. Unfriendly inexperienced staff in the reception!!!"
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Great lay out and rooms were comfy and clean. Staff were all really friendly.

pegasus-reef, 10 ,Location
pegasus-reef, 10 ,The best place to unwind and relax. The staff are very helpful and friendly. 
pegasus-reef, 1.0 ,"Sunshine. Nice pillows. Awful hotel 20 years out of date. Smells and battered. Noisey, basic, more like a hospital than a hotel. Gardens more like a public park than a hotel."
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,"Clean. Location close to Colombo Asked for a double bed, got two single bess pushed together.
Two guests, only had one water bottle.
Pictures have a bathtub, room does not."
pegasus-reef, 4.2 ,"The property is positioned on a wonderful reef location and has a sizable physical footprint.
The hotel rooms were adequate but needed ongoing maintenance.  The first room I checked into had a closet door missing. This caused the light inside the closet to be constantly on. Having a light on all night is problematic for sleeping.The next day I was moved to another room.This room had a refrigerator that was improperly installed which caused the refrigerator door to be open all the time which would result in a warm fridge. The maintenance did remove the fridge and placed the fridge under the desk so I was able to have a working fridge in my room. The hand held shower nozzle in the second room completely fell apart and I notified the maintenance on check out.
The deck chairs and loungers are in poor repair. The pool area is in need of maintenance and is not appealing to North American traveler.
The dining room area is open and is very hot. Much of the food that is placed out actually withered and even melted in the extreme heat.  The restaurant should be encased in glass and air-conditioned.
The food quality was poor.
I ordered a meal from the à la cart restaurant (Sea Food) with a friend and after an hour of waiting realized they had not even put in the order. The manager did try to appease the situation by offering an extra serving of french fries. I consider this to be a very weak gesture for poor service.
Ordering a non-alcoholic or alcoholic beverages in the restaurant also seem to be a challenge. It appears that these drinks come from the bar area which slows down the restaurant staff ability to deliver a beverage. Perhaps the restaurant should have some bar services at the restaurant rather than trying to obtain them from another department in the hotel. Staff did not follow up on a timely basis with me to see if additional drinks are wanted. This happened when there were only a few guests In the restaurant and a ordered a la carte.
The walls inside the main restaurant have openly peeling paint and is in major need of repair. The chairs and tables in the restaurant are also passed their lifespan."
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Location was good and rooms were clean. Also Fish restaurant was delicious (10 points out of 10). Part of staff was friendly and nice. It was far away and if we took city tour, we got person who didnt speak any english, so it was waist of money. Asking from transport departement about this, we didnt get answer at all. Very rude!Every time I asked something from reception i got answer ""NO"". (asked different facilities- tennis, massage etc.) Im sorry but our friends, family and relatives are going never visit this place again. If we will visit then only fish restaurant that was the best!"
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,"Please improve the service response time...this needs to be improved and House keeping quality also not upto the Mark requires frequently reminders to serve.Food quality is good, I enjoyed alot the sea food basically in Pregasus Reef.Looking forward to see improvements. Service response."
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,The staff were polite and helpful. Rooms were clean. The location and the facilities are not worth the money.
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,"Breakfast and dinner were perfect. The selection was plentiful and trays were filled when depleted. The staff was polite and helpful. The check-in took about 2 hours to finally get the room type that we had booked. As the hotel sells pool tickets to outside guests as well, the pool is overcrowded and noisy."
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Everything is good
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,Location and the staff  Staffs are very friendly and polite and professional and the  Location is perfect .
pegasus-reef, 10 ,"The food served at their seafood restaurant was excellent. All hotel staffs were always wearing a smile. Staffs were very accommodating and helpful. I had the pleasure of dealing with Ms. Eranga, who helped with my booking of a conference room. Cleanliness could be better. Some attention to details with regards to cleanliness."
pegasus-reef, 3.3 ,"Not a lot! The fish restaurant was quite good, the main restaurant awful  It’s adjacent to the beach but you can’t swim there. Dirty plates in the restaurant. No toilet paper in the bathroom. Definitely not 4 star"
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,Beautiful Place  TV working but No Channels.
pegasus-reef, 5.0 ,"Reception staff were friendly, thanks to them they upgraded our room to superior and it was lovely and clean. Tennis court although quite old, but nice to have. Food was decent, very nice desserts and also friendly chefs. The hotel is boring, small pool, not enough of sunbeds, such a big outside area and no activities, the beach if you can call it beach of hotel was so dirty, such a shame..  main bar staff were always slow and rude, when asked for coffee said we would need to wait for 20min as he would need to get it from downstairs, went downstairs and got a coffee in 5min. Dissapointing for such a hotel. And location is not nice at all. Also the security check like in airport at entrance is so unwelcoming."
pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,The place Reception staff
pegasus-reef, 10 ,everything in general. food was good .staff were excellent. we were made very welcome.
pegasus-reef, 10 ,I like the location and cleanliness of the property !  Nothing to say

pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"Everything was perfect except the point i mentioned above.  Room  was very clean. Bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly! Enjoyed the stay 😍 The only negative  thing i noted was , in one of the drawers (in the room) there were two cup cakes which they haven't replaced for days..how could you keep such drained cup cakes  when even doing daily room services?? It's something that gave me a disgusting feeling. 
When coming to the outdoor facilities, the service in sea food restaurant is so poor.they take more than an hour to serve our ordered food even when there is  no much crowd. Service in  sea food restaurant is poor."
pegasus-reef, 1.0 ,"I didn’t like anything at all , hotel staff doesn’t respect a I order room service and I received the worst food after I complained they were like yes that’s how room service work. Actually hotel staff is the worst from the reception they have no respect they treat you like you going to stay there free I would not recommend this hotel or their smelly rooms to no one"
pegasus-reef, 1.0 ,Poor staff and not enough AC

pegasus-reef, 6.0 ,"- big bed
- the garden
- near to the beach & ocean 
- rooms must be reconditioned, especially the bathroom
- low presure of the water
- long waiting time for 2nd night dinner 
- old sunbeds"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Good large rooms for a great price and large breakfast buffet A bit out of the city centre so not really appropriate for sight seeing in Colombo
"
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,The rooms were good.my bathroom drain was clogged .breakfast was good .overall good hotel. Everything was good ...only no lift for senior citizens.
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,check in & chect out process was vry easy & quick. It took more than 90 minutes to deliver the foods to the room. clealiness of the washroom not upto the standard.
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"It’s a beautiful well maintained hotel with very polite and welcoming staff. It’s the perfect place to get anyway from it all. It’s quite and very peaceful  This property is 35 mins outside of Colombo. It’s misleading to state that it’s in Colombo when it’s not. 
Also avoid the restaurant it’s not worth it. "
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,The pool and grounds where beautiful The beach was in swim able
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Only a very short stay but feel happy of the surrounding, facilities and services. Buffet lunch was really great. Hope to come back again soon"
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Beatiful hotel, staff is very helpfull, spacious rooms, very good food in the fish restaurant "
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Great property.  Very commercial.  Not personalised enough
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Early check in was arranged easily. Staff friendly and helpful. Room was a decent size with a nice outlook. The Fisheries seafood restaurant was great. A/c never cooled the room below 25 degrees despite being attended twice by maintenance. Water went off halfway through my wife taking a shower. Breakfast was stone cold but the staff in attendance were more interested in talking than listening.
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"The location was great! And we had dinner at this restaurant inside the hotel called the fishery. The food their was really good and worth the price. It had amazing view of the sea. The room was very clean and tidy and the staff also was very supportive. And breakfast buffet from the main restaurant was also good.  It was a Sea View Room, but the sea was barely visible from the room. And the hotels buffets variety of food needs to be expanded.  "
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Rooms were comfortable, view excellent, Open area inside the property is nice Location is isolated. Nothing like walk in restaurant, shops near hotel"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Good places for a short stay. Room service is good and efficient. No wow factor though.
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Shaun (one of trainee) is the guy at reception with excellent service mind .
He gave me a good advise for Colombo city and make a reservation for my wonderful dinner. Thank to you"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Friendly team members from all department. Beach hotel but not possible to use it very dirty and signal to not swimming due to sea condition all time.
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Location , service Food"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Close to the airport 30 minutes Not much shops or anything at  walking distance
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Comfortable and friendly staff Not nice beach, a lot of garbage. Could be cleaned on one day but for some reason no one cares..
"
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Excellent staff even providing a birthday cake as a surprise for my husband
Nice room
Excellent dinner in seafood restaurant 
Nice pool Alcohol expensive 
A bit isolated but good position to get to airport"
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"This property and staff made our stay in Sri Lanka so fun and accessible. They were especially kind to help us when we wanted to go to different parts of the island. We always felt known and cared for. It isn’t a beach front property in terms of having things to do at the beach. But the pool is beautiful and comfortable. You can still see the ocean, you just can’t swim or lounge in the sand and sea."
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"1) Very friendly staff,2) Excellent Breakfast with lavish spread of dishes, 3) Great Room service,4) Great Housekeeping,5) Sea Facing Balcony with good view,6) Value for money,7) Very honest staff and excellent Lost-and-Found department:    a) I forgot my backpack in the Seafood restaurant, and got it back the same day with everything intact.    b) I forgot my mobile phone in the Open Air restaurant, and it was promptly found and returned to me by the staff.8) Good Live music in the evening.9) Check in and check out were very smooth,10) Good location, away from the city crowds. 1) The beach had lot of stray dogs. While I'm a dog lover and didn't mind it. However my partner was rather uncomfortable due to their presence.  Hence we couldn't spend more time on the beach.2) The Hotel Airport shuttle was overpriced in my opinion. The Airport shuttle to Pegasus hotel cost us 5500 LKR.However an Uber Sedan from Pegasus hotel to the airport cost us only 3192 LKR.3) At times the noise levels were a bit above usual, due to Parties and Events occurring in the hotel"
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"The pool was great and a lovely location near the beach. Rooms were nice and spacious too  Nothing, the hotel was great for a 1 night stay before going to the airport. May not have wanted to stay much longer as not much round there. One suggestion which could have made it even better is that the you can walk directly onto a lovely beach from the back of the hotel. But there was lots of rubbish on the beach which spoilt it. The hotel could make this area  much nicer for their guests. "
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Very good location and very comfortable.  I know that I should have been more careful when I made the second booking for one night only, but it seems have to pay as much for that one night as I will be paying for three nights of the original booking for six days. Approx $150 for the night of 21st November and approx $300 for the next 6 nights. In the same room."
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Pool was nice, bed very comfortable! Happy hour isn't what you are lead to believe...naughty on behalf of the hotel...25% off all drinks within 1 hour...then they add on 3 different local taxes and tell you it's the same all over Sri Lanka....no it isn't!!"
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,Staff was very friendly. I travelled with an infant and they helped us every way possible. Buffet was great. I liked the food and it was tasty.
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,Clean room
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Nice hotel with very good value for money and the staff are very good always helpful and available. The hotel is a bit far from the city center but closer to the airport (feom city center) a good hotel for a relaxing holday. Cqnt swim at the beach on which the hotel is located
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,Location. Specially the restaurant 'The Fishery' has amazing food. Nothing
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,"The place is a bit out-dated and worn, but still nice. The interconnected family rooms were definitely a major plus. We spend a nice couple of days in the hotel - but location is not attractive. We strongly recommend having dinner at the Sea Restaurant where both food and service are superb :-) The rooms had quite a strange smell coming from the bathroom."
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"The extra bed in our room had a mattress of decent quality. The garden of the hotel is wall laid out. There is a spacious feel throughout the property. Staff was friendly and helpful. There were stains on the tables at the reception. It made me fear for the general cleanliness of the property, but this fear was unfounded. The rooms were clean."
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"The care taken by all the members of staff (be it at the reception, housekeeping, gym, restaurants....) was extraordinary... The welcome basket of fruits and the 'elephant towel' (see pic) were highlights along with the food.... Everything was fantastic at this hotel! "
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,Great staff. Friendly atmosphere. Great breakfast and lunch buffé and a really nice family room deluxe. Pool-staff is the best Ive met in the whole of Sri Lanka. Buffé and drinks are far to pricy. A general problem in Sri Lanka at tourist-locations. So much cheaper in other simular countries like Thailand.
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"The facility, beach and the feasibility to Airport There was no shower curtain in the bathroom tub, which vaused the bathroom to be fully wet."
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,Rooms are good and spacious with a balcony. Restaurants serve good food though if you stay for a few days you would get bored of the food as the same thing repeats days on length. The fish restaurant is super It is a bit off from the city and so moving around is an issue. You can't use public transport or cheaper methods of transport from here. The beach is not a walkable or  swimmable beach. 
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Very clean and nice rooms, beds were very comfortable and the staff very friendly."
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"Hotel is good , buffet very good ...it's a nice one night option before u fly but the beach is not so nice...u can't swim there Beach not to swim"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"House Keeping was really good.  Reception Staff were friendly. Location and approach to the property .Egg Station not competent enough and very few options.Breakfast menu - So monotonous and standard. Need Variety.  Its Boring to have the same food daily."
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,"Courtesy of staff, reception. Open spaces, greenery, Infrastructure, balcony.  No good store or shops nearby. Fishery menu is limited. "
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"Nice rooms, but bit small compared to all the other places we stayed. Swimming pool and beach access is good however swimming is not recommended in the beach. They were ok to keep our luggage as our flight was late at night and so we could go to colombo city.Uber was easily available to colombo and airport. Everything was fine, but nothing exceptional. No lifts, we had a stroller for baby and had to carry it up and down the stairs. Our huge Luggage(due to baby) was carried by the staff, a lift would make their job easy as well. Cab/Uber/tuk tuk to colombo in the traffic takes 45 min easily. (Due to rains it took us 2 hours one evening)"
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Very comfortable.  Although it was located next to the sea, the beach was littered and swimming in the sea was not safe. "
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Plenty of space in the hotel and the grounds. Nice pool and a good restaurant, The Fishery, in the grounds. "
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"Excellent location at the center of the city, surrounded by many good restaurants, nice and helpful staffs. The room is clean, unfortunately it’s without window and there is a pillar in the room, this makes me uncomfortable.
"
pegasus-reef, 6.7 ,Room was comfortable and clean. Food we had was good too busy. Checkin process unnecessarily long and check out not smooth. Beaches not swimable. Pool too crowded to enjoy.
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Very nice hotel, clean, very helpful staff, amazing fresh seafood at The Fishery restaurant. Unfortunately, dirty beach with no facilities. They should clean and arrange the beach because they have wonderful possibilities by great location. One good point for them: we asked for sun beds on the beach and arranged immediately. A very good option to consider for a nice holiday in Sri Lanka!"
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,Fantastic facilities and variety of food at great value for money.  Felt they were understaffed and services could use an overhaul. 
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Pool and fish restaurant  Could not swim in the sea

pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,There are poor privacy of wash room which coudn't lock ROOM # 103
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,1st hotel I have ever stayed in where I have had to pay the bill before given my room key!
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Beautiful property, good buffet option, comfortable rooms and not too far from the airport. No complaints with the hotel itself or the services of the housekeeping and restaurant staff. Getting to main areas of Colombo can take quite a long time and Ubers are a little hard to find in the evening to go out from the hotel. Perhaps the hotel can tie up with some transport agencies and arrange for taxis at short notice."
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"The fishery restaurant awesome.Nice garden. The hotel itself,is outdated,look like no refurbishment,last 5-8 years.Is situated on a bad area,nowhere to go, unsafe for western behaviour.Roads outside are terrible,dogs all arround,no chance walking anywhere else,without taking a tuk-tuk.Good transit airport,40 min away,trip."
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,Das Restaurant „The fishery“ war sehr gut. 
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,staff location
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,The staff are amazing. The housekeeping fashioned the new towels into an elephant - the kids loved it. The property is a little bubble on a coastline which is awash with trash. The locals need to respect their beaches a lot more
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,"The manager and staff who were superb. Very friendly and efficient The room size The bathroom size The cupboard small The breakfast staff"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Lovely property, ideal for airport stays. Great facilities & staff (on most part). Beautiful grounds and swimming pool! Service did not reflect the ""4*"" facilities. Staff in The Fishery restaurant are in need of extra training just to get the basics of good customer service (taking orders promptly & delivering quicker). There was only 1 staff member - Amad, who understood this and went above and beyond for us when an order was wrong. On several occasions we were left waiting to order when there was an abundance of staff stood around. I was then mimicked and laughed at by a bar staff member and chef when I had to go up to get someone's attention."
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"It is fresh with a very nice swimming pool. At one of the restaurants, the ""Fishery"", the five fish plates were excellent!!! (except one). The whole restaurant (Fishery) is a very nice place. Most of the restaurant staff is very nice. Both restaurants have certain organisational problems. It's fine, it's OK, but everything takes a little too long time. Sometimes the staff seems to have the wrong focus."
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"Great check in, friendly staff and nice pool area. 
Rooms are very nice and clean. Perfect stay not far from the city with easy access into Columbo. The fishery restaurant on site is absolutely amazing fresh seafood!l, reasonably priced. The buffet was disappointing and some food cold and the restaurant area was dull."
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"The pool was nice, the food exellent and the rooms very comfy and clean. The beach is not suitable for swimming; there was even a sign telling us not to go swimming there. Really disappointing! There is nothing outside of the hotel."
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,The reception and porters and roomboys were all very friendly and made me feel at home directly. The staff in the restaurant ( at breakfast) was not very friendly (compared with the other staff).
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Fishery  .... If you are staying in Pegasus reef hotel ... Enjoy the seafood at fishery restaurant...staff are responsible and responsive .......no  spa in the hotel ... and No travel packages for tours and email to Harsha the manager in charge  did not elicit a response ... hopefully they come up with one very  soon regarding travel tours inside Lanka and in and around Colombo ...however the guy in the travel desk helped in  arranging comfortable  cabs ...
pegasus-reef, 6.7 ,"1. the overall property is good2. swimming pool and gym are good3. room size and facilities are good4. Staff was excellent 1. food needs to be improved at the main restaurent2. Location is a Big Mius3. Beach was not swim friendly"
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Good hotel, great staff, amazing food. Nice location on the beach."
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,Comfy beds and staff helpful.  Noice from outside. Remote location.
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"“Lovely property, ideal for airport stays. Great facilities & staff (on most part). Beautiful grounds and swimming pool!”"
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"The Fishery restaurant was really nice and had reasonable prices. Our room was clean and bathroom had a shower with hot water and good water pressure. Also the gym was okay and included in the room price. 
The location was convinient for an easy access to the airport (~30min in the morning). 
Unfortunately we didn’t have breakfast because of our early departure time.  The location isn’t ideal if you’re staying longer. We only stayed for one night before our departure. 
The hotel doesn’t have airport transit, but they will call you a taxi/uber. However they couldn’t do it the night before and insisted that we call the reception in the morning when we are leaving.. they also said that we are leaving too early for our flight, but I’m glad we did since there was queues at the airport. "
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Food was good, beach was nice and room was comfortable.
 Check in was bad, My wife entered the hotel while I park my car and the reception has told her that we dont have a reservation. We went to the hotel for our wedding anniversary and guess how she felt. Hotel staff has told that we dont have a booking.  
Then I showed my confirmation and they arranged the room. If they confirm the booking through booking.com they must be aware of us arriving. Restaurant staff also doesn't have a clue about guests. I went to get my mains after starters and they have cleaned the table and removed my water glasses etc. "
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"Great lunch-buffé. Good pricing on the pool-side-menu. Friendly staff. Good service. Great pool-staff. A bit pricey to order from the bar, like many places in Sri Lanka. A big nice grass-lawn, perfect for kids to play ball games on - but we where chased away because ”it would ruin the grass”...:(Other than that - a great place for a few days relaxing before heading out in the country or down south."
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Good customer care, morning breakfast is nice and the staffs  are very  cooperative  , almost a good hotel to stay,  except the traveling parth  and the dirtiness,    Little bit far from the main city, dirty and roads are not comfortable to travel to the hotel "
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"Personnel very friendly, especially Sean who gave me a very warm welcome Beach: no swimming allowed;
Nothing to do close to hotel area;
Many crows around pool area
"
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,Amazing breakfast was on offer and great extra facilities (gym and pool). Staff were very friendly and helpful. A little far away from airport and colombo centre.
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"Its was a bit further from the city than we expected, but still not to long with a taxi or tuk tuk. The hotel was beautiful and clean, and the staff were nice and helpful. Food was good in the restaurant. Not a lot of space to chill around thee pool - they could allow some more sunbeds around the area. The beach is not a beach to go swimming at, therefor the pool was nice."
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,The warm welcome Location unless u have a car nothing is near and it did not have beauty salon as I travelled to attend a wedding .but staff was very nice
pegasus-reef, 6.7 ,"The room was clean and well arranged. The staff was friendly.  The yard was very nice as it was facing the ocean and had a lot of shade. The restaurant had good variety, yet the taste is not satisfactory. The restaurant had a good ambience but some parts of that is yet well maintained such as the sink."
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"Location is quite far from Kolombo city, but You can take tuctuc for 400 Rupies, hotel is clean food is quite good.  It’s not 4 star standard"
pegasus-reef, 8.0 ,"Beach, must be clean"
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"The staff is so accommodating and friendly they treat you special and the food was so great. Value for money is good. You can easily access the amenities like gym, pool and tennis court. Especially Tharidu who always make our room clean. They always ask for your needs. It was an enjoyable stay. I didn’t like about the beach area it’s not clean there’s lot of trash.."
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,"The fish restaurant is superb! excellent value. Worth staying here night before departing for airport as only 25mins away 
The outdoor grounds are lovely.  The interiors and rooms of hotel feel dated (but is undergoing renovation) and a bit soulless. Classic conference hotel with lots of corridors and rows of rooms. "
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The food was good with a large variety. 
 There wasn’t much to do around the location and we felt like we were in a compound. "
pegasus-reef, 6.7 ,"Breakfast is amazing, and the people who work here are extremely nice and very helpful. The new fish restaurant is great, and the beds are really good too. The gym is really bad, the pool is mediocre and the rooms are okay."
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,Location is isolated so it is quiet.  We only ate breakfast and it was good.  Not much to do but relaxing and very nice staff. Not a great beach but probably not why people stay there.
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"hotel located close to the beach in wattala area. Room condition is great.. interior design good. and very comfortable. good space inside. white tall reception at the front desk(forgot his name) is very friendly. Food quality good. variety of foods"
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,The beds are comfy. And facilities good Bad smell near the rooms at the end of the corridors. The menu is monotonous. Need more variations in taste as well
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Hotel Reception is good  they are nice people and had a good welcome. Room is comfortable and clean. not much space inside the bathroom but its ok. Clean bathroomsBed really comfortable with blankets and pillows. we like thatNice balcony with Pool view. They offer variety of food for the breakfast . Srilankan and wenstern Service of the main restaurant should have been better.There is no good welcome from the restaurant. they keep asking the room number even we provide that entering the restaurant.  another lady came and ask the room number again while we having the breakfast. And it was very hard to find a table. even we manage to find one there is no spoon fork or knife on the table. there is no one to ask for. so we had to get that from another table by our self. there were no tissue or napkins on the table and no one closer to ask. no one serve drinking water glasses for the table . these things need to be improve"
pegasus-reef, 6.7 ,Family room was nicely payed out with separate suite and bathroom. Renovations right now so pool not so nice looking.  Party in the gazebo made room noisy until 11pm.  Should ask if gazebo booked for party before booking.
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,Far from shops or anything
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,They ask me to pay for breakfast and diner while is include the booking!!
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"We liked the breakfast buffet and the quantity of available options. Also, we had dinner at the restaurant, The Fishery, and everything was delicious. The grounds at night are well-lit and very romantic. The hotel is very isolated with little around it, but some might enjoy the quiet. The beach was a little disappointing, and it could use some upkeep."
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,The Staff were really friendly and In Room dining was really fast
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Locationlocation and hospitality, staff are very friendly nothing and everything to the order"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Close to the place that I had business with Surrounding was dirty 
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,Relaxing and comfortable location. As a regular visitor at Pegasus the staff goes out of their way to make our stay very pleasant. I would also like to thank the management for letting me checkin at 11.00am (3 hours before the checkin time) as my flight landed at 7.40am.  The A/C was not good enough.  The temperature in the room never went below 26.5°. In their defense it was a very hot and humid day.
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,stuff is very nice. and i like the breakfast and the view. only it's a little bit far away from Colombo
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,Good hotel.  Everything is OK but it is not allowed to swim in The beach as it is dangerous. 
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,Staff were very unprofessional for me they are not suitable for hospitality industry. The approach and the attitude needs to change. The hotel itself is a very good one the location is very nice. The communication between staff is very poor
pegasus-reef, 6.5 ,"The room was comfortable and the food was atleast decent
The breakfast is ok, doesn't cater to much for westerners , we had to ask for things to be made for us
The chocolate is delicious We didn't like the fact We were put in a room with a interleading door which has no sound proofing
We had to listen to the others tv from early morning and their talking
We didn't like that we were not informed that the next day there would be no alcohol served, due to a religious holiday
The company lost a lot of profit from us with not selling alcohol
Some simple communication goes along way
I didn't like the fact that men searched my bag with regards to the recent issues in Sri Lanka and security at the gate spoke no English and wouldn't let us in
The place is looking tired, needs repainting and the walk way to ur room is dark and just messy looking
The beach area is so dirty with plastic and rubbish, was very disappointing to go to the beach
Plenty staff that sit around which can go pick up the trash"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,Good stay
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"The food was amazing and the rooms were clean and tidy. There were no elevators and it was a problem for my mom who has arthritis. The shower cubicle was not seal proof as the water was seeping out to the floor. Please have butter knives, salt and pepper on all tables."
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,Staff were helpful and breakfast was good. there is a swimming pool for kids which allow our kids to enjoy using it.  the Fishery restaurant was very good for sea food dinner and the service was great. they provide baby cot without request the beach was not allowed to use  and we didn't aware about it when we book the hotel
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Staff courtesy is best ,"
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"Fish restaurant was amazing
Great staff Location was a bit remote"
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,This hotel is wonderful . Room is very clean. Breakfast and dinner are awesome and delicious . Hotel staff so friendly and helpful .
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,very comfortable room and helpful staff at the reception For european guests the breakfast could have been a little more various. Maybe that was caused of the few european guest there were.  For example when I was there there was no cheese of meat for the bread. Maybe it was allready finished but they should give this more attention. I visited Pegasus many times and all the previous times I was very satisfiued with the breakfast so maybe this time it was an exception
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Very comfortable for relaxation and recreation There is a freshly restaurant overlooking the pool for seafood good prices and excellent food by the chef Nalaka 💙  in cooking distinctive and fluent arabic cooks,
 I would highly recommend visiting the hotel The spa its closed,
 Room service is not 24 hours and their services are slow"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Clean, convenient,  comfortable ⁶"
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,"Very friendly staff and very helpful, service excellent, great location ,very picturesque and close to Colombo.  Food at the fishery was average.
Dinner buffets were average, tea or coffee was not included, had to pay extra.variety was limited. 
Rooms
Mainly the grouting had mould and the bathtub had mould around the tub.
The room service menu needs to be looked at, very limited selection. 
"
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"The location is great I was only there for a short night but from what I saw and had, it was great. The staff were friendly and helped me a lot.  There are a lot of rooms and guests."
pegasus-reef, 7.1 ,Staff attitude but breakfast was not fresh it is very basatis Environmental
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"The property is well maintained and the rooms are clean. Had a nice sit out where you can chill during evenings. It is a nice beach side property. The staffs (from room boys to front office managers) were very super friendly and full of smiles.  The breakfast costs $10 and restaurants inside the hotel premises are quite pricey. 
The location is little outside the city but Uber is just one click away. 
Need to scan all our bags while getting inside the hotel. But that’s acceptable due to the recent incidents. The security staffs are friendly and helpful. "
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"close to sea. palm trees, nice pool. friendly staff. nothing really. it was nice stay."
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,"Front Desk staff who checked us in at 2:00am is friendly and professional, sorry can not remember the name but he was alone and following afternoon again I met him at the Reception. We asked for connecting rooms and allocated accordingly. Very quick check in process did not delay us unnecessarily. Also the security personnel who were scanning the bags were friendly and well mannered. Keep up the good job.Bellman who escorted us to the room explain everything as well as made it simple and did not waste any time. We were tired, and went to sleep straightaway.Overall Front Office staff are friendly and attentive. The hotel located far from the main road, I found little difficult to get a Uber or pick me drivers to come there. Not a major issue as there are tuk Tuks near by. Hot water is switched off very early and switched on little too late, if you want to take a hot shower early, it could be a little challenge.Room service food delivered covered in cling film !!! Please get some proper items, you are a 4* hotel. Also the food delivered were pretty cold when it delivered, plenty of room for improvement.Overall I felt there is a little challenge in the Food & Beverage side, Breakfast is just ok, two consecutive days we stayed, same breakfast, nothing change, food is pretty ordinary and I feel the value  is less than the price charge for the Breakfast. Staff at the breakfast restaurant is not attentive, definitely I could see lack of Management there. You could see staff in “pocket meetings” in middle of the restaurant. With little training this could defiantly be corrected.Had a drink at the Lobby Bar, surprised to see the place is empty. No effort has been put by the staff to keep us there, just one drink and we left . I could see lot of potential to promote this place specially due to it,s location."
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,"Room setups good
Nice staffs Restaurant area not good "
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,Food could have been better 
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,"The rooms were a good size and were really clean. The shower was great and the bed really comfy. While the property is on the beach, it’s in an industrial area and not good for swimming unless you like brown water.
The pool area is a concrete slab with hard wooden loungers."
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Helpful and friendly staff, great vibes and hood views A bit far from the main road and the ride there was very bumpy"
pegasus-reef, 8.0 ,Large size rooms with adjoining room for children. Nice pool. Excellent Fishery restaurant. Good distance from airport. Friendly and helpful staff. Understand the Hotel has had to look at other streams of income generation but school two large buses of school kids were a little noisy for other guests wanting a quiet time.
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,Clean rooms Bad service at restaurant. And poor quality foods for breakfast buffet. Gave me and my partner both tummy aches
pegasus-reef, 6.7 ,Room view  Too dark outside 
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"The location, safety, friendly group of people veiling to help you with any question. I was able to check-in very early before time with no charge, room was cleaned and ready. This is my second stay looking forward to come again 2020. Rain and the traffic nothing to do with the hotel. No elevator, only 3 levels. This will help the older people to get to their rooms. No music around the food court, this will help every one to enjoy the food."
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,This place is good if you want to spend time always from city hassle ..property is nice. Excellent property for families I would suggest since it is at such a secluded place .. Please and some spa services  inside the resort..good for people to come and relax
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,"Complimentary breakfast was good; Staff members were very courteous and helpful; Rooms were maintained well; Had a comfortable stay; The garden area was great and the music played in the restaurant was good. Most of the items in the menu were overpriced; Not many vegetarian options in the menu card;Location was a bit far from the city center and there isnt much connectivity from this place - had to rely on taxis and autos to commute;Felt that the hotel was overpriced for the facilities it offered."
pegasus-reef, 8.3 ,The place and staff was awesome. Was bit disappointed because no one came to receive us. After making the booking I mailed them to arrange airport transfer but I guess they didn’t even bother to reply back to my mail. Overall me and my husband enjoyed our stay😊
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,The hotel location was not far from the beach and can walk to the beach within the hotel perimeter fence. The climate was wonderful especially the evening time. Also this hotel is not far from Colombo city as well as airport. Staff were very friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was normal & we stayed just one night only. My booking was a room of tripple beds all Adults. But was given standard room with one large bed & extra folded bed which is not comortable- unable to get better room even after talking to house keeoing supervisors as they said hotel is fully booked due to election and they could not offer better room. This is not acceptable reason as my booking was well in advance & was confirmed.
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,"Breakfast buffet was good - lots of choice
Option to pay for the late checkout was good
Room was clean, nice sized bathroom We were woken up a few times in the morning when staff were cleaning rooms nearby and chatting, as well as guests walking past the room. There does not appear to be much insulation between rooms and hallway
Chose this hotel as was possible to pay extra for late checkout - however feel it is overpriced in general
Lots of events going on and company days - didn't give a relaxed holiday vibe
Went for a short walk along the beach where the hotel is based and there is so much rubbish in the waters and beach, really sad to see - feel the large local businesses could do more to maintain the area
Would prefer a double bed rather than two singles pushed together
"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,The staff was really nice and very friendly and really cooperative throughout our stay. We had booked a room on a honeymoon package and it was really not upto expectations and with their standards we are really sure that they can do some improvement to offer a couple seeking for a honeymoon getaway better. 
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,"Good location Need more water bottle as complementary. One one small water bottle is not enough to drink and make coffee .If you ask one water bottle more; you have to buy at LKR 300"
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,"Comparing with my previous stay. i can say there are much more improvement with the stuff rooms and cleanness and also restaurants. Room is modern and much more comfortable friendly stuffvariety of food for the breakfastMany Choices for the in-room dinning There are higher security scan going on with modern scanners for the checking procedure which make the stay more safer and relaxwhen you walk through the beach at night you can see  Colombo city and fort which bring nice view Overall happy with the service and room"
pegasus-reef, 9.2 ,Entrance support

Would recommend for a night or two upon arrival of departure in Sri Lanka. It felt a little like a conference venue because of the size of the place, but otherwise lovely! 
"
pegasus-reef, 7.5 ,The room was good for a standard room with a balcony.  The AC was not working properly so we had to ask maintenance to fix it. The food is alright nothing extraordinary. 
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,close proximity to family
pegasus-reef, 7.9 ,"The staff is very cooperative and friendly. The food was AMAZING!!!!!. It is a very dated building for starters; it is not disability friendly, the room was not the cleanest, and the carpet throughout the hotel needs to be  taken up. Upon checking in I wasn't given information about events, times nor locations for breakfast or dinner, and if you like room service there wasn't a menu in the room, therefore you must call room service and hopefully they have what I want. No coffee or tea in the rooms  just an hot water kettle, and if you want to do an excursions it's best to go with another company because the hotel does not have a list of offered excursions. Soon after I asked about excursions I was offered a half day tour of Colombo for 30 USD (one child and one adult). "
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,All in all the hotel was good for the value and the staff was professional as it should be. Being a hotelier my self I could rate the staff who I encountered to be at their best. Keep up the good work.  Nothing at all except for the noise which disturbed us from the morning on our check out day. Can’t blame the hotel since it was a private gathering. 
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Room is spacious they have all amenties,Hotel is in front of the beach. There is no lift.My room was on the first floor.

pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,I like the staff.specially i want to mention Mr.Sisira in the All Day Dinning Restaurant.he is very friendly and always giving attention to the guest. I don't like the view from balcony.the view is totally  covered by the  trees.one more think keep the extra phone chargers at the reception.when i ask to charge my mobile they said they don't have.plz don't say no to the guest without offering any alternative.
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,Nothing
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,"The facilities was fantastic. Really worth every penny spent. Staff was very friendly and attentive. There was a little issue with the 1st room we stayed but the hotel and the staff responded quickly and gave us another great room. Very helpful and professional service. Food was very good the variety is very interesting. Really enjoyed every second we spent there. Hope to visit there again very soon.  There's nothing to complain about the hotel as it was a fantastic experience for us. Only thing was the beach was filled with garbage but hotel has got nothing to do with it. But for the sake of luggage carrying and old personnel, a lift would be a great addition. "
pegasus-reef, 8.0 ,"Friendly staff, clean room and nice beach view from the balcony. Bit far.
We booked for honeymoon room but there is no any fruit platter in there we expected that, but they didn't kept. they charged for honeymoon package $92 . bit dissapointment.  "
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Amazing service - we chose this hotel as we needed to be near the aerodrome the next morning.  Very comfortable rooms, service second to none,  could not have been more welcoming.   Suresh Rasika the chef cooked me the most perfect grilled tuna especially for me as I didn’t want anything too spicy. Cordon-bleu standard.  Thankyou Suresh  It could have been even better with a good clean.   Windows and glass not spotless, if this together with cleaning g up the little beach was done would give it 10/10"

Andrew was especially helpful and was also able to remember our requirements - making is feel like valued guests.The facilities are great and make Pegasus Reef a great place to relax after or before a trip from the airport. The buffet breakfast had an excellent choice of various dishes, both western and Sri Lankan. Taxi drivers don't seem to know where the hotel is and I had to guide them using a map on my phone. Maybe a better description in the directions to the hotel would be helpful."

pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,"Staff members were very kind. Worm welcome, clean comfortable room. Meals were fabulous indeed. I made only a small request to arrange a small surprising thing to celebrate our wedding anniversary suring our stay at the hotel. They have did it well. They had arranged an amazing and surprising bed decoration. And gave a very beautiful cake with a beautiful icing decoration to celebrate our anniversary for free of charge. I didn't even expected such a great treat. I would like to greatly appreciate it. Highly recommend. Specially for honeymoon couples."

Breakfast have many choices, friendly staffs, nice view of Ella gap  The pillow case smell bad like head oil, guess the housekeeping didn’t change the case after used, water came out from the toilet bowl, shower pressure was a bit too low. "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"I really love the place where the hotel situated is, the food was super delicious, and the staff were so accommodating. Best hotel in ella. "
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"Great location, great service, delicious hot curries at good value and very friendly staff.Easy walking distance to the village and other sightseeing. Clean bathroom! Perhaps the check in could have been a bit faster.. but we did enjoy the welcoming refreshment."
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,"Helpful staff. It's a bit expensive. It was nice, but you would expect more for the price. The property is falling apart a bit."
ekho-ella-ella, 9.2 ,The view from the room was amazing. We stayed in a suite with access to our own hot tub. This is probably the best accommodation in Ella. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. There is no buffet but this is a boutique hotel so that makes sense.
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,Ekho is perfect. This is an exceptional hotel. Ekho is perfect. 
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,Amazing breakfast! Great view from our room. Very nice stay.
ekho-ella-ella, 9.6 ,Perfect location a very nice view and a great staff 
ekho-ella-ella, 9.6 ,Its a very nice hotel amazing location
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,Perfect location to explore the mountains around Ella. Personal was very helpful and kind to us. 
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"The view is super, and was complemented with large nice rooms. The service is great with everything you need. Breakfast is delicious and lots of options. Also the food in the restaurant is good, and dont forget the cocktails. And that all for a great price, and friendly people.  We had nothing to complain."
ekho-ella-ella, 9.2 ,"Great location, so friendly staff. Worth to stay for the price  Nothing much to mentioned "
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,Location is great however the sunrise views are outstanding. To be honest the rooms aren’t as grand as they are advertised and the smell of clove oil is quite over powering so definitely turn this off as soon as you enter the room.
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Such a beautiful hotel with a stunning view. All staff are amazing and keen to help, great service. Food in the restaurant was also really good. Location is perfect for hiking and eating out in the Town, would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to explore Ella.  Nothing, was well worth the money paid to stay here 
"
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,Great central location - Dinner and breakfast were both well presented and tasty
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Amazing view, great beds, great breakfast There was nothing we didn’t like! There weren’t many English channels but that was it."
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,Very friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and comfortable. The view is extraordinary and the girl is very conveniently situated with a 3 min walk into the main strip of Ella. Highly recommend overall.  The rooms are modeled on old train platforms and the bathroom doors are a little tricky to easily enter for this reason. The spa was a little open to others sitting and enjoying a drink on the hotel lawn. 
ekho-ella-ella, 9.6 ,"Location, view, room Breakfast could be better "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Everything was great! The room, the view, the staff! 
Also, Because we had to check out early in the morning the staff of the hotel packed our breakfast! "
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"The staff was excellent, really outstanding! The view is amazing. We can highly recommend the hotel"
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,The most amazing service you will ever receive. The staff will go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. The location is another highlight!
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Staff were super helpful. We wanted to start a hike up Ella Rock in the early morning. At late notice the hotel organised a guide and an early breakfast. Nothing was too much trouble.Quirky rooms (in a good way) and fabulous views"
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,"The breakfast was amazing, you can choose from a menu. Very appreciated. The service was excellent also. I believe the mark is a bit high compared to the real situation and the hotel itself. I won't give more than 7/10 honestly to the establishment. But the service and breakfast are excellent. Rooms are standard."
ekho-ella-ella, 9.6 ,"Great clean hotel with amazing views 
Food is also very nice , complemented with great service  It is on the more expensive side in Sri Lanka 
It would be very reasonable in the U.K. though "
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,Amazingview
ekho-ella-ella, 8.3 ,"Very clean and comfortable room 
Amazing view  Extremely noisy as the main road is exactly next to the hotel 
No swimming pool "
ekho-ella-ella, 8.8 ,"Super fantastic view of Ella gap, super nice breakfast
Very nice viewing balcony and garden. Breakfast with full view of Ella gaps. Just at the perfect angle No Swimming pool. There is one jacuzzi which was very exposed (probably could plant some trees around it) and it closed in the evening quite early we couldn’t use it at night "
ekho-ella-ella, 9.2 ,Beautiful location. The sunrise was amazing. Food was really good and the staff was friendly and helpful.
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"You've got to get up at least once to watch the sunrise. It comes up from Little Adam's  Peak and the views are stunning. In fact at any time of the day the views are stunning... 
Whilst the food in the hotel is amazing its location allows you a choice to walk into town in less than five minutes and sample food and drink elsewhere. Whilst on the subject  of food you should try their Sri Lankan breakfast... it's delicious and you wont need lunch!!!"
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,Fantastic view! Great staff!
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"A beautiful small,  boutique hotel oasis in Ella, close to everything. 
Stunning outlook down the valley and of Mt Ella. 
Great breakfast included, stylish rooms.
An incredibly relaxing place. Could have stayed much longer! Next time 😍
 Food very pricey in the restaurant "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"The place was amazing, it had such lovely view from the room of Ella Rock and Ella gap. The staff were exceptional, they went out of their way to meet any request. It was my birthday while I was there, they even surprised me with cake! Absolutely nothing!!"
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"Great location, very central to the main restaurants and hikes. The beds were a little hard however, this is a minor detail."
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"The location is perfect and the view is amazing. The breakfast which was included, is a la carte and was delicious. Super friendly staff. The room is big.  Nothing negative. "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Such great service from the EKHO team. Everyone was so kind, friendly and helpful. The room was perfect, very clean, lots of space, modern and the view from our window couldn’t be beaten! Also it’s literally just outside of the main town area - as in a 3 min walk to all the restaurants and shops which was great. I would recommend this place to anyone! "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,The staff going out of the way to ensure our requirements. Particularly the Manager was very energetic and was seen looking into all areas.
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"We thought the views in the photos might have been a bit exaggerated but they weren't. It's as if somebody bought the perfect bit of real estate in Ella, with uninterrupted views down the valley and then everyone else built stuff a bit below, or a bit behind.We got upgraded from a deluxe room to a suite (not sure why) but I would have been very happy with the deluxe. The rooms are the same but the suite has a private hot tub in a conservatory style add-on to the room.  If hot tubs aren't your thing, don't bother. There's another one in the garden with views down the valley!One of the standard rooms is almost in the basement with a view of a wall - avoid that one.There's an odd shisha  bar just off the reception lobby that I never saw anyone go in. To be honest everyone is transfixed by the views from the garden area, terrace and dining room and doesn't want to sit anywhere else.The food was delicious, Breakfast was a la carte and the menu ran to 3 pages. We asked what was included and they said everything so if you wish you could just keep ordering. We were on half board for 2 of our 3 nights. There was a much more limited menu at dinner but it was all well prepared and presented.The town of Ella is quite lively with lots going on and only 5 minutes easy walk away."
ekho-ella-ella, 9.6 ,"Beautiful location. Delightful stay, I will be back to visit again.  The bathroom doors were odd and hard to close but not really enough to complain about. "
ekho-ella-ella, 9.6 ,Stunning views.  Close to town and local sites.  Nice restaurant  Would have expected a nicer room at this price but it was comfortable enough.
ekho-ella-ella, 9.2 ,"Very close to the center, nice rooms.
Excellent breakfast outside in the garden. Nothing."
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,It was a really nice setting and beautiful view. Room was clean and modern. Staff were ever so helpful. So close to the centre of Ella.  No pool but there is a hot tub to enjoy the stunning view from. 
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,"Great location, beautiful view. Comfortable quirky rooms. Friendly staff and wonderful food  Bathrooms on 1st floor slightly damp smelling. "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,Beautiful setting!  Attentive staff!  Breakfast was wonderful!
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"Staff were polite especially Hashan, the waiter and food was amazing with generous portion. Had a great stay.
 Honeymoon suite could use more lighting."
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,Amazing hotel with breathtaking view.
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,"Location, view, climate and people."
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,View and room Parking 
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,"The view over the Ella Gap is stunning, the staff incredibly helpful and kind, with great food and clean well presented rooms. Good location for exploring Ella. I would definitely stay here again if I returned to the area. "
ekho-ella-ella, 10 ,Very very good place. Peace and quiet. Not a lot (none?) similar places in Ella!
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,Lovely staff and a stunning view from the room of the Ella gap. Dinner is of high quality and an extensive breakfast is served. Price is pretty high. The beds were a bit to hard for me. On the shower floor were some dark spots visible. 
ekho-ella-ella, 8.0 ,"Very central and 5min walking distance to center restaurants, shops and bars. Gorgeous panoramic views of the scenery. There’s a huge outdoor area but a shame there is no pool, just a hot tub."
ekho-ella-ella, 9.0 ,Nice hotel
amaya-beach, 6.2 ,The location The poor service from the staff and the beds on the triple rooms were smaller than expected
amaya-beach, 7.1 ,Location is very nice. Foods are delicious
amaya-beach, 7.1 ,"We’ve been to this hotel back several times. However, following the change in management, the staff are very unwelcoming and took so long for us to check in and check out! The staff, cleanliness and the food. The buffet was distorted."
amaya-beach, 5.0 ,Too expensive and 29% USD tax.
amaya-beach, 6.7 ,the staff at the reception was very moody and not helpful
amaya-beach, 3.3 ,"We are a family with 4 young children travelling from the UK.  We choose the hotel as a base because it is located within driving distance of family members we wanted to visit.  We booked three double rooms for a family holiday, prior to arrival we/bookings.com made several attempts to amend and clarify the booking.  The hotel was extremely difficult to get through to.  Eventually bookings.com did get through but the hotel was unable to facilitate our requests.We were travellling with children and we arranged for rooms to be adjacent to each other, which i was assured would be arranged however they were spread out scarcely on one floor.On the date of arrival, we were travelling a long distance and we informed the hotel we would be arriving late (around midnight).  We arrived just after midnight and the hotel reception seemed empty besides 1 member of staff, who checked us in.  He seemed quite disinterested in any form of communication in this check in process. He just gave the keys, no direction or arrangement for luggage.  There was no meet or greet or welcome.  As mentioned before we arrived just after midnight and corridors on route to room had lights switched off.  One of the three rooms was not prepared.  Dirty, no towels, fluff and human debris,  wrapped mango in tissue found in bed of one room.  Requests for towels ignored and when reminded no apology.One of the rooms we booked for our driver and security tried to refuse entry, until we had kicked up a fuss as we confirmed the number of people with us and we did not exceed the maximum capacity.The standard of fixture & fittings were sub standard for this grade of hotel.  Door handle falling of, grouting on tiles dirty and broken tiles.Generally the level of communication and customer service was lower than expected and experienced in other hotels.This was exacerbated by us observing white European occupants being treated in a much more welcoming manner."
amaya-beach, 5.0 ,The location Specially food.very poor.we had the dinner and we saw they kept the same chicken curry for the next day morning breakfast.and didn’t satisfy with food of Amaya
amaya-beach, 6.7 ,"The scale of the hotel, especially the lobby is very impressive. The rooms are big and the beds very comfortable. We had much better food in other, less expensive hotels. The worst thing was the beach - swimming in the sea is a bit of a must for me on holiday, but the beach edging the hotel garden was so full of broken bits of dead coral that you couldn't get in it to swim without cutting your feet and being in pain. The hotel shop could make a lot of money selling those shoes that protect your feet in the water, but they don't sell them. Most of the beaches in the bay are private to the hotels, apart from one stretch of public beach that apparently had less coral and was better to swim in. This was completely full of locals however and us girls didn't feel very confident about going there. The pool is a good size, but not as big as it looks. You couldn't swim properly in it.  It was also very, very warm, not refreshing at all."
amaya-beach, 6.7 ,Beach was calm and beautiful.Good location.Nice place to enjoy the holidays. Could not pay from the cards due to technical failure.Had to go for a ATM machine for withdraw money.
amaya-beach, 5.0 ,"Very good rooms, cleaningness Noisy (music until late), lots of kids in the pool, short menu in the restaurant. Unfortunately far from the offer of other resorts in the area. "
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,Nice resort with good facilities. Great beachfront/pool area to relax and have drink. Friendly staff. Overpriced wine with taxes on top of the displayed price. Beach was pretty ordinary.
amaya-beach, 7.9 ,firstly they charged the twice amount which was stated in booking.com and i had to get a confirmation letter and to get refund once again which was inconvenient
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice and clean, good pool, close to the ocean. Good spa treatments. Good food.  Beach out the front was unusable with minimal sand and broken coral remaining however a short walk to a nice beach. Some more shade close to the pool would be good. Drinks and food service around the pool/ deck chair area would be great. "
amaya-beach, 7.0 ,Nice delicious food. I like to go to À la carte menu than buffet. Full clean well maintained room. The place is beautiful. I think the hotel do not like to host loacal guests. And they pay less attention to them. Booked sea view room and received court yard view room. I had to call three time to order in room dine. The menu said mix grill served with rice but no rice served. Second day at night I orderd pot of coffee to room but it never came. (Funny thing is I had to explain them what is the POT OF COFFEE is... first they though Im tring to borrow a empty coffee pot.😄😄)
amaya-beach, 10 ,"We were almost alone at the hotel so we had the pool and the beach for ourselves, beautiful view and very calming experience. 29% tax + 10% service on top of everything"
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,nice place and nice view in the early morning. The property is very clean and tidy. also our room is very comfortable. 
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,clean and nice facility with friendly staff.Good food choices price of the food is very high
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,The room was great and the facilities. The prices were expensive for what was given.
amaya-beach, 8.3 ,Really good buffet available. Close proximity to beach. Some of the staff were very friendly. Over-charged for room and took a lot of calls and hassle to get this rectified. Some staff in restaurant were not very friendly or helpful - seemed a little under-staffed.
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Great room rate for a 5* hotel.
Staff polite and appeared happy in their work.
Restaurant buffet had a great selection and the desserts were fantastic (both in presentation and taste). That all bills were subject to ""applicable government taxes"" along with the 10% service fee but staff were unsure of the government tax percentage.
I was told 30% but eventually worked out from a bill that it was 20% when I stayed."
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"location and serenity, room boys were noisy"
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,Rooms were large and the view was great from the room. The Sri Lankan thali was amongst the best I've tried in Sri Lanka. Staff were friendly but seemed a bit inexperienced. The beach in front of the hotel is not usable.
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"The location near the beach, the pool, the restaurant( maybe little bit expensive) staff were good.. Loved my stay... Food was good.."
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"Large BathroomsAttentive StaffLarge swimming poolBalconiesbeach is greatGreat buffet breakfast The amount of crows on the grounds"
amaya-beach, 10 ,Fantastic hotel.
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,All
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,"The location is excellent. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Food was great.  The gym is falling apart, machines are mostly not working, yoga mats look and smell like they were used as bedding for a herd of cows. "
amaya-beach, 10 ,All facilities in your hotel are excellent. Nothing
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Excellent place n service. 
We booked only for 3 nights. And ended with 4 nights.  They offered us a special discount which no one match it.  
Great bunch of young staff.  
Very friendly and hospitality on its best.  "
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Location , staff , buffet ..❤️❤️ I couldn't find dialling codes... they should be near the ☎ .."
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Food
Service from staff 
Nice big rooms  Boring architecture of the hotel.
Aqua cafe could be much more clean 
"
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,"The property was very grand and located on a nice stretch of beach. The pool was great and the pool towels were massive. The grounds were very well maintained and lots of staff around. Food from pool bar and room service were both delicious. Bathroom was ok, powerful shower.  The safe in our room was locked, we didn’t bother trying to fix as only there one night just mentioned in check out. The mini fridge wasn’t stocked, and they were going to resolve but didn’t. The tv reception was poor. Room service difficult to order as they didn’t seem to know what was on the menu and seemed surprised, then the order came different to what was expected. "
amaya-beach, 9.5 ,The Sri Lankan food at Amaya Beach is just amazing! Coming to think of it we only had Sri Lankan food for all the 3 days of our stay. The beach is right in front of the property and it is isolated from the main beach and gave us a private-beach-vibe.
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,"The view is amazing. The rooms were not cleaned properly one of the washrooms was full of fallen hair. 
The food is rich but there is no flavour in them . Even bacon tasted bad. They really need to change their chef. Same trip we had 100% tastier food from a 3 star hotel. So if you guys wanna keep up your standards maybe consider your chefs cooking . "
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Hotel is beautiful, located on a nice long beach, spacious and newly built rooms with all necessary facilities. Pool was beautiful and restaurant very good. Staff was very kind and welcoming. Definitely a great price/quality option.  All good"
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Even if we only spent one night at the hotel, we liked our stay so much. Staff was highly professional, the location was amazing, nice and very clean rooms. Also, good food. Loved it! "
amaya-beach, 10 ,Excellent service
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"Very good location if the food is halaal and verified by srilankan halaal the hotel will be full The interior and the rooms were big and had lots of sports and activities wide but space area"
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,good breakfast we were unable to swim due to coral ... disappointed:-(
amaya-beach, 10 ,Friendly staff
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,Some disturbances in the night from a crowd.
amaya-beach, 10 ,Very swish modern hotel with a stylish contemporary feel. There were very few guests when we stayed so we had all the luxury to ourselves. Food was good and the staff very friendly and helpful. We wanted some down time to chill during our travels and this was perfect. There were lots of other facilities but we only used the pool and sun beds!
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"Friendly staff, and food was good. Nice and large rooms. My second stay there. Reaching to location is very far, nothing else you can do there. Also they must include more seafood items"
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,"Pool, sun beds, proximity to beach, very relaxing, beach bar had great food but quite pricey for the area. Very quiet as off season. Breakfast average for the price. We mostly ate in neighbouring village.  Glass panel between bathroom and sleeping area was a bit weird!"
amaya-beach, 10 ,"The rooms are massive, the beds luxurious and the staff are amazing. If you can get a massage at the spa with Manoj you won’t regret it- it was by far the best I’ve had in Sri Lanka ever.The buffet was fantastic and the wait staff and chefs are always smiling. The service in the whole hotel is great. I would like to see a more environmentally friendly approach. They only served plastic bottle water instead of having re-fill stations and gave straws in drinks and packets of sugar... all of these could be easily replaced with eco-friendly options."
amaya-beach, 10 ,"The staff are amazing. All so friendly and helpful. The spa therapist Manoj gave the best massage I’ve had in Sri Lanka.The Sri Lankan breakfast and buffet food is phenomenal.The rooms are massive and beautifully designed with comfortable beds and gorgeous bathrooms and for the affordable rate this 5 star hotel exceeded my expectations. I’d definitely come back. Nothing I loved everything."
amaya-beach, 10 ,I like almost everything.. There are some people entering to swimming pool without proper suit and without take pre shower. And management of the hotel is doing nothing about that..
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,Nice beach front
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"Breakfasts were great, dinner buffet was awesome bar selection was good, service was 1st class, lovely views of the sunsets on the bay. Discounted room price due to limited tourists. AC couldn't handle 35 degree outdoor heat, coolest the room got to was 25°"
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"Nice place with a beautiful view of the beach. Comfy rooms, tasty foods. A good place to relax."
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"Big beautiful, clean room facing the garden and swimming pool, and then beyond the garden the beautiful peaceful beach. Warm welcoming in the lobby with wet towel and strawberry juice. Nice massage in the spa. Gym available. Very price worthy all in all at this quiet time in June. I was told that my luggage would be brought to my room, 2 hours after check in it was still not there. I picked it up myself in the reception after this. 
I asked if the kitchen could make some vegan food, I was told no. This is a simple request that I expect could be fulfilled in a 5 star hotel. It was very easy to get some vegan local dishes at another hotel restaurant close by; such as rice, curry, dahl, papadam.
 After enjoying a massage in the spa first day, I asked if I could have another one the next afternoon. I was told it was not available, even at this time there were very few guests in the hotel. 
The gym was very small."
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Value for Money, Friendly staff specially girl work in reception. "
amaya-beach, 10 ,everything nothing
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,"Great location with very nice beach front and swimming pool!Excellent staff and food Value for money"
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"The staff made the hotel. And the coffee was excellent The dinner menu was mediocre . Room serve took for ever"
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,The two ladies at the reception - Prija and Jathu - very extremely helpful in supporting us with the planning of our onward journey. Great guest care!
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,Nice room with comfortable bed! Breezy atmosphere and attentive cleaning staff. Nice property! Buffet was just ok. Room for improvement there.
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Great room, friendly and attentive staff - good facilities at the property. The food, the bar, and the pool are superb! The beach right in front of the hotel might not be the very best, but walking to the left for 2 mins solves the issue of a stony entrance into the water. Personnel was very attentive, they just did not manage our booking extension very smoothly."
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"Loved the beach, the swimming pool, the luxury feel to the rooms, the mattress, the swimming pool staff (Sisil), all of it. Food was nothing special compared to what we had in cheaper places, and not cool that the 'cocktail of the month' could not be served, for lack of arrack..."
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Great big and clean rooms, clean and well maintained beach, superb pool, lots of shades for kids, food was amazing and menu was never repeated in 4 days while there. Free usage of billiards, board games and table tennis was also big + for the kids. Nothing."
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,"Scenaries were good, and breakfast was fantastic. Service was excellent.  Dinner was not good. "
amaya-beach, 10 ,"We liked everything! Slept soooo good! Especially the friendliness of the staff! Made us feel welcome and at home!
Loved the Honey Beach Bar!  WiFi was working irregular - but still best WiFi compared to other places in Sri Lanka. "
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Room was excellent, staff was excellent, view was excellent! The pricing and the quantity of the food was not to expectation. Could make it more value for money."
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Room was  super  and large  very good clean,staff was very good,srilankan  breakfast was tasty,its a very good resort for relaxing."
amaya-beach, 10 ,"The hotel is in a superb location at the seaside with many activities to do such as snorkelling, dolphin watching. jet skiing etcThe bars at the hotel are very relaxing.  We only booked with breakfast but then the night buffet was excellent and we had a discount and therefore had all our dinner at the hotel.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  In particular, a receptionist named Priya was very helpful in sorting out our requests, she managed to locate my room and my friend's room next to each other as requested and near the poolside. We could not seem to get a spa appointment at a convenient time but somehow she managed to sort this out for us by speaking to the spa admin and arranging the appointment as we requested. The poolside attendant did disappoint us as we had asked him whether there were any more pool umbrellas because they had all been occupied by others.  It was a hot day and I asked him for an umbrella.  He told me in broken English that they were 'finished'.  I then put my chair under a tree bit further away.  10-15 minutes later a different group of people came and he brought 4 umbrellas and gave it to them.  I do not know whether he did not understand English or whether the umbrellas were pre-booked, but the hotel did not say anything about pre-booking the umbrellas."
amaya-beach, 10 ,"5 star resort and facilities. Pool was great. Comfy pool beds. Facial was amazing according to my wife. Nothing, everything was great."
amaya-beach, 7.9 ,"the hotel is in a great location and there are a few cute eating places approx 10 minutes walk or 15/20 in tuk tuk.We had a ground floor room Rm 115 and is was near the kitchen ans was way to noisy at night up until 12 midnight and then noise again at approx 5am -  Just ask for a room no wear near the kitchen.The water has rocks immediately in front of the hotel however 3 minutes walk opposite the park the water is easy better from swimming.   The staff were friently and helpful OUt room was way to noisly"
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Because the staff speaks bad and sometimes not even English, many mistakes were made."
amaya-beach, 8.3 ,Excellent Door closed ac
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"The place was amazing as usual, this was my second time there. Clean pool, great place to relax. They did give us a very poor single bed."
amaya-beach, 10 ,Staff was exceptionally forthcoming - especially reception did everything they could to make ours stay perfect! We extended 2 times!!!
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Amazing rooms
Amazing staff Need better shower pressure
Pool too shallow"
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Cleanliness, staff services and location
 Welcome 
Security personnel are not willing to accept guests.
They are thinking too much on security whether we are guests or terrorists.
"
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"The room we had was very huge and clean, also we had a short way to the private beach. The staff is very attentive and courteous, the food was excellent and varied. Nice kind of show cooking on the outside of the restaurant. You get free towels to chill at the beach and the pool was big enough to swim for while, also very clean. You can chill right in front of the beach. There is a small beach bar where we took some lion beers and enjoyed the view over the ocean, also we had a snorkeling tour right next to the bar. This we must recommend! There is a small fitness room with the most needed machines and a room where you can enjoy some freetime activities like table tennis. We did not use the spa so there's no feedback possible. At first it was frustrating that the private beach is covered in corals, so it is impossible to swim here. That must be said. BUT if you walk a short time you reach a public beach, which is not ""that"" public, not many people here. Also kind of a private beach. There you can swim perfectly. Also the drinks were a bit expensive but I think that is something you have to go through in such an resort."
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,Good None
amaya-beach, 7.5 ,Good Nothing
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"great buffet breakfast and dinner - half board option - lots of choice for all tastesstunning outlook onto beach.perfectly clean and comfortable rooms, hotel and pool - crystal clear.only stayed 2 nights as part of our trip. airconditioned gym with water and towels supplied :) although air conditioned - the gym had a few machines out of order."
amaya-beach, 10 ,very clean and supportive staves.
amaya-beach, 8.8 ,"The location is perfect - we really did have a sea view, and the beach is lovely. The spa is really good. The room was very stylish (particularly the bathroom) and spacious.  The food wasn't great value for money, and the selection of drinks was limited. Room could have used slightly better maintenance - several lights didn't work, for example. Wifi was slow (sometimes unusably so) and troublesome to connect mobile devices to. "
amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"The location of property was just right, could see both sunrise and sunset. Loved the view from room too... spacious room and property to go around... Response in Cafe shop was awful, they didn't attend to us, instead super-ceded to favor other western visitors to the cafe"
amaya-beach, 10 ,"+ Very good restaurant. The food was perfect. Whoever runs that restaurant knows what he does! (I had the best Pasta with Bolognese I have ever ate there)+ The rooms are very cozy, big enough and luxuriously decorated. A perfect fit for two nights if you need to regenerate some energy at your Sri Lanka trip after a lot of travelling and lower priced hotels+ Very clean overall+ VISA Payment - Booked a driver over the reception and it was approximately 30% more expensive then usual booking. As we had not a number of any local driver of the town we did take the option, yet it was from our opinion and experience very overpriced!"
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,"Breakfast was excellent, the room was super comfortable and the bathroom amazingly large and well-laid out, with an excellent rain-shower...The proximity to the beach was good, and the pool was lovely Being a long weekend, the property was rather crowded, especially at breakfast and in the pool. Spa was good, but quite expensive for the service offered. Lot of flies in the breakfast area, even though it was indoors and air-conditioned."
amaya-beach, 9.6 ,Staff was incredibly: professional and friendly. Very good breakfast and beautiful pool. 
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Amazing staff,good food I had to pay for the sauna"

amaya-beach, 9.0 ,Beach
amaya-beach, 9.0 ,"The overall impression is minimalist, but palatial. Amaya has everything you would expect to find in an upmarket resort: large pool, excellent cafes and restaurant, gym, private beach. The rooms have all mod cons and are spacious. The food comes in the form of a sumptuous buffet with a huge selection of foods and some tasty Sri Lankan specialities. The staff are ultra-friendly and always ready for a chat or a laugh, creating the perfect resort atmosphere. Only two negative aspects: you cannot go into the water at the private beach as it is very shallow and under the surface there are sharp rocks. The pool is too shallow which makes it very warm."
amaya-beach, 9.0 ,"Beach side accommodation.Friendly staff.Good Restaurant facilities. Nothing"
amaya-beach, 10 ,"This hotel was excellent, very clean and big rooms, very good breakfast and very friendly workers. This hotel also have a friendly price. I'll for sure reccomend it 😄 I even asked Jathursicka to help me put on saree, she was so helpful 😄 Thank you our girl Jathursicka and the tamil boys (around 20 years) in the reception, plus the boys (around 20 years) in the breakfast area to make our stay perfect 😄 "

amaya-beach, 10 ,"The family suite we upgraded was really nice. It was really a nice experience to look at the ocean first thing when you wake up. 
The staff was amazingly nice! Food was good. The pool was biiiig and really clean. Loved the overall setting. The beach right in front of the hotel had some corals. So it was a bit hard to walk far in the water. Water shoes would solve this issue. But I found a nice spot within 100 meters."

amaya-beach, 8.0 ,All the staff was super friendly. The place was clean and beutiful. Food was nice. The sea was too shallow. Difficult to have a nice swim.All the staff was super friendly.  There was a girl in the reception that could have done bettter.
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Location, Facilities 
 Beach - too many Corals 🙁"
amaya-beach, 10 ,"Excellent English Breakfast including a mixture of local cuisine and the location is easily accessible with wide carpeted roads and the hotel has a large well maintained garden along the beach. Swimming pool is clean and warm. Priya and Chathu at the front desk was very professional and they assisted us in our booking until we checked in and checked out after 3 nights. Their warm personalities were very impressive. They even arranged us a ground floor room as it was needed for our daughter. If you are looking for professional hotel service, all necessary star class facilities and extra value added for your money, this is the best hotel in Passikudha. We will definitely visit this hotel again! Nothing to complain"
amaya-beach, 10 ,"The hotel was having only a few guests, but the staff was really friendly and was great indeed. The room essentials like hotel amenities (soap and the water bottles) were not there in the room. But again overall it was value for money. A good breakfast was included in our stay. Nice beach. Please go and have your stay. The room was so comfortable.The location is facing the beach and can bath on the beach too. The pool was superb and with a nice view. Recommend for couples, families, and corporates Nothing much. Overall it's good. But advice them to keep the hotel essentials in room same as in the tourist season and give some attension to the calls we make during our stay to request items. We requested soap and water bottles several times on call but not received us.I think that was happened due to lack of staff as we were there on the Sri Lankan presidential election day ."

amaya-beach, 9.2 ,"A lovely hotel excellent rooms and facilities and food  The staff need training a case of enthusiasm and lack of attention to getting it right
On arrival I was mobbed by 3 reception staff or greeters and 3 reception check in staff all wanting to service me after a journey to the hotel it was a bit too much one guy was particularly annoying 
I used the spa had a sauna and it went off after 10 minutes I had to go to spa reception to get it switched back on 
I ordered room service and it was delivered minus the dessert 
Attention to detail please
The staff are lovely but get it right
Still a good hotel though"

amaya-beach, 10 ,"Room, staff Nothing"
amaya-beach, 9.0 ,"The food was exceptional in terms of its detailed preparation and we could feel that the chef had put in real good effort in giving us food that we could truly relish to our heart's content. The portions were good and the food was really tasty, better than what we expected...The facilities were excellent and very well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful.Rooms were great and very well lit and spacious. Ours was a free upgrade and we did get a fantastic deal out of our stay. We can stay here again should we travel to baticola or pasikudah in future... nothing I can think of. However, I think they can employ a couple of more people for pool side purposes. One guy is not enough to cater to everybody's needs at the same time. Not humanly possible."

amaya-beach, 8.0 ,"Location is fantastic. Comfortable. There should be more variety of meals including fruit juice such was not available. Buffet charges should be in the 8000 rupees price as in room with breakfast, lunch and dinner will be 8000 rupees per day. Bar can be separate. I didn't like the fact that food was not included in the 8000 rupees room. Please make sure no one smokes at and in the property. As ladies we did not feel comfortable at all. Hang many directions board and signs as we keep getting lost and search our room."
amaya-beach, 10 ,Everything 
amaya-beach, 10 ,"we loved everything: location, room, beach and ocean, food, service and staff. one of the best experience in sri within 3 years.

actually we were in another hotel and came to amaya just to have nice coffee near the ocean. but after communication with mentioned lady and due to her high professional behaviour, we decided to move to amaya)) and everything was perfect! "

amaya-beach, 9.0 ,"The infection prevention mechanisms were well designed and superbly executed. Staff appeared well trained to face the 'new normal' under the pandemic. All staff members, be it at the reception, restaurants, pool or house keeping behaved in a well choreographed manner, making our experience enjoyable with the least amount of hassle. I haven't seen this level of training and coordination elsewhere. Understandably, the dining options were somewhat limited compared to what they used to be, but the taste was excellent and the service was great."

shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very beautiful hotel. Friendly and helpful staff who are very professional. Beautiful spacious room with a stunning view (Premier Ocean King). Extremely comfortable room and superb bathroom. I Upgraded to use Horizon Lounge on 32nd Floor. Very beautiful and peaceful lounge to relax. Overall great experience, and would recommend to anyone who can find a good deal (booking.com offered a good deal for me). However not as expensive as some would expecy Shangri-La to be. Guest services and in dining prices On par with similar hotels. "
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Amazing 2BR apartment.  Very modern, spacious and comfortable. Excellent beds and bathrooms. Shang Palace serves excellent Cantonese food. Breakfast was also very good (Horizon Lounge). Service across the board from check-in to farewell was exemplary and impossible to beat. Staff is super well trained. Asian service at its best. Nothing. Our brief stay was perfect."

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"It is good hotel 
"
shangri-la-colombo, 8.3 ,"food was superb. Room was especially clean and comfortable. Reception staff at check-in use jargons such as 'blocking your card' and were reluctant to accept VISA DEBIT saying that it was not a CREDIT card! They then advised I pay with cash but I stood my ground until they accepted the debit card! They try to impose that it is a MUST to pay a 'deposit' but this was an option for you to pay them in advance for any facilities you may use within the hotel (apart from room service!) as I managed to understand after spending 45 minutes at check-in desk!!! What's more confusing is I used my debit card to book this hotel on booking.com, the same card I then tried to use at check-in and had to argue with the receptionist to get her to accept it! Very stressful check-in."
shangri-la-colombo, 8.8 ,"Everything meeting expectation, breakfast, complimentary water was generous. Bed was confortable. Ocean View from room was side, not really front view, maybe bad luck with room. Nearby buildings under construction too close to the hotel. Will affect some rooms privacy once they are being used. Bathroom on the small side. "
shangri-la-colombo, 7.9 ,"Check in, staff, services was all perfect.Special medical treatment has been organized super fast and fully satisfied with all the support. Washroom was not clean when we arrived :-(Environmental smoke from burning outdoor fires entering trough A/C and Air circulation system could be smelt in hotel corridors as well as the rooms!!!"
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,clean. great facilities. exceptional service the air in the room was dusty/condensed.
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,Service was great and lounge facilities and staff were lovely. Breakfast buffet could be improved by offering more food. The bacon was a little odd too.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,The Staff were so courteous!! And food was simply amazing!!
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,The assistant manager at the table one restaurant could improve. We had a very long wait to be seated and he wasn't very polite or accommodating. Complained about him to the manager. The manager was great and super helpful.
shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,Beautiful room & view. A little pricey but worth it!

shangri-la-colombo, 9.0 ,"Loved the staycation Offer, the suites and its facilities and the super service  The Central Restaurant felt understaffed where the servers at many of the station were juggling many functions. As a result there was long waiting times for food to actually arrive. Was really frustrating. "

shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,"Great breakfast but it's the same every day.. other five star hotels change the theme every other day or so...Quick service.. Room service food is top chef-level quality  Staff are great and always smile and help without hesitating. Pre Authorisation on my credit card takes a long time to clear. It should be released within at least 24 hours. Hotel staff asks so many personal questions.. this is cultural and they do it with seemingly good intentions but should refrain from doing so, and keep questions about the hotel experience only."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Everything was perfect. 
All the working staff were very friendly and professional. They also gave us an upgrade from deluxe Ocean view room to a premiere Ocean view room in higher floor with a box of tea as a gift. Breakfast was very nice with different food options. Really enjoyed our stay. I would recommend it to everyone.  Nothing "
shangri-la-colombo, 7.1 ,"The room was well appointed, very comfortable bed, appreciated the Ceylon Spa amenities which reminds you that you are in Sri Lanka. Breakfast was excellent, varied, fresh and beautifully presented. I booked an Ocean view room and requested a higher floor.  Before I had even been offered the room I booked, I was informed I had to upgrade to be on a higher floor and when I mentioned why, was then told that infact they would give me the 16th floor as a courtesy.  The whole check-in failed as instead of feeling welcome we ended up feeling like we were somehow to be grateful for receiving what we booked.  I am sorry to say Concierge, bar and pool staff fared no better - poor.  We often stay in Shangrila hotels around the globe  whether for business or pleasure and it is my preferred hotel group, but I would probably not stay in the one in Colombo again."
shangri-la-colombo, 7.5 ,The beds were comfy. The toiletries were excellent especially the bath gels and shampoo. The two bedroom suite had most of the things we needed. The lifts been used to carry luggage.the bell boys were trying to squeeze the guests in the same lifts. The staff seem to equate attire to attitude.

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Everything Nothing
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Staff are really friendly and always there to help you . I would say great service.
shangri-la-colombo, 5.4 ,I opted to stay at this hotel for 2 nights at the end of a 2 week vacation. The standard of the room was as expected. The main reason I chose to stay at this hotel was to use their pool facilities. Unfortunately the pool was undergoing maintenance during my stay here and their were several men in scuba diving equipment in the pool making repairs. This made my stay here thoroughly unenjoyable. Guests were not notified of these works or advised of an alternative hotel pool nearby which we could use in compensation. Their seemed to be little acknowledgement from the staff that this would lead to an unsatisfactory guest experience. At the very least staff should have offered  poolside guests a complimentary meal from the bar pool menu. Overall very disappointed with my first stay at a Shangri-La hotel.

The king bed room was what we booked but the twin room wasn’t. When I pointed out to the reception staff that the twin room didn’t have an ocean view as we had booked and enquired about a possible discount, they explained to me that all twin rooms were like that. I felt mis-sold which was disappointing in a Shangri-La property."

shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"The staff were all amazing, very attentive. We upgraded to horizon club, which gave us access to the 32nd floor lounge, where we would have breakfast, afternoon tea, snacks and drinks. The manager there Prem was a great host as was the duty manager that was on site when we checked in - he gave our little boy a elephant teddy which was cute. The facilities available on site were very helpful, like the in house tailor - Kumar, he did a fantastic job with adjustments I had on a dress. Elina and Nimeesha both helped me tie a sari on separate occasions which felt very comfortable. Fayaz at concierge was very knowledgeable with all my questions I had. We also had the same housekeeper everyday, he was very patient with us as we would take forever to leave the room. Sorry I didn’t get his name but thank you. Finally the staff outside the hotel that would get us taxis/tuk tuks were great, always helping us in and out and taking care of getting the pushchair into the vehicles. A great hotel, with impeccable service."

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,The staff were super attentive and friendly - especially at the door and in the restaurant. Has nothing to do with the hotel but there’s constructions going on at the pier so stands a bit in the way of the view. There’s no noise coming through though.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"the impeccable service, the comfort of the room, the breakfast buffet, the free tuk tuk service. It's a really nice hotel to stay in when in Colombo! The staff are very helpful & they try their best to make your stay as comfortable & enjoyable as possible There was really nothing that we didnt like about our stay"

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Everything Nothing
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Food, Room, Service. 10/10 Nothing"
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Everything was up to standard. Breakfast was lovely. Just some labels on the pastry selections for vegetarians and allergy sufferers as some of the things looked like they had nuts in them and I just decided to avoid them. Though all the food was great tasting and in great variety. Coffee, Juices, Confectioners and Stable breakfast choices to keep anyone happy.
Check in took a little longer than I am used to but the experience was overall pleasant. Polite staff, apologetic for waits and pleasant greetings and conversations as you walk through the hotel. 
The room is spotless and beautifully taken care of. All new and updated with an AMAZING shower to just let the water cascade over you. Universal plugs with chargers for all types of mobile devices. Nice views of the ocean. A large comfy bed to drift off into the night. Great! Everything was amazing and what one would expect from this standard of hotel and more.  There are no real critiques for the hotel really. The only issue I had was I asked for the room service trolly to be removed and no one came up meaning I had to ask twice and then leave the trolly outside the room to be collected. But that would be the single, ever so slight annoyance. "
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Shangri-La Hotel was one of the best hotels we have both stayed in. As visitors from Ireland we were given a 'Céad Míle Fáilte' and up-graded to the club floor at a reduced price. This hotel we highly recommend - friendly and outstanding staff and facilities. Thank you and well done to all.
shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,Loved the food services and hotel cleaness. Would be better if check in services had welcome drinks and if someone took you to the room  and told you more about services and things 
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,Appointment 1021👍👍
shangri-la-colombo, 8.3 ,"Bar looks super cool. 
View is very amazing. 
Bed very comfortable with very nice pillows. 
F&B staff are very nice. Maneesha is great.  Staff do not address me by name only address main guest by name.
Public area very nice but rooms do you meet expectation. 
In room dining is not the best. 
Pictures of room do not reflect how room really is."
shangri-la-colombo, 7.9 ,"The food is amazing! Lovely comfortable and clean rooms, great spa/pool/gym.  A lot of staff with not much to do, feels like they are bored. And as a consequence a lot of annoying chit chat conversations that get started by the staff. "

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Everything! Absolutely nothing to dislike.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Staff were amazing & nothing was too much trouble
shangri-la-colombo, 8.8 ,The hotel has a good variety of restaurants food is delicious and service is excellent. Spa was very nice and i enjoyed the facilties too.
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,Nice comfortable hotel. Slow checkin rooms weren’t ready even at 3:00 pm and food at their famous Chinese restaurant was very average. 
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Newly opened so everything is till new, nice and comfortable. Service is good."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Lovely staffs chris concierge and raminder front office made our trip extra special with their helpfulness and professionalism. Rooms and bed is so so comfy and in room dining even gave us bread to our orders FOC. Chris as concierge made sure our needs r met and raminder even extended our check out time no extra charge. Swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam room is just so good.  Shangrila really exceeded my expectation beyond than a 5 star hotel! Nothing!"
shangri-la-colombo, 8.8 ,Staff courteous the lift is very confusing & restricting the travel at various levels may be required for safety but is too complex
shangri-la-colombo, 8.8 ,"This is a lovely hotel, the facilities (in operation) are excellent, the service is good (although tips are expected everywhere you go within the hotel) and overall we had a enjoyable stay. Our flight out of Colombo was late in the evening and the locker and shower facilities on the fourth floor were a boon for being able to prepare for that after checking out earlier in the day. It couldn't be helped and our timing was poor, but the pool was out of action for the two days of our stay which was disappointing. The hotel did offer a ""complimentary"" tuk tuk service to a nearby hotel but the staff there didn't seem to know about the arrangement so that was awkward and not the same as being able to head off to the pool whenever you like. The yoga session that was supposed to take place on Saturday morning was not on without any explanation and after several attempts to book in the day before - also disappointing."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Everything !! Executive suite & lounge & staff were par exellence Nothing
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great location brand new ultra modern property. We had a corner room on 15th floor which gave us uninterrupted views of the ocean from 2 sides.Staff always ready to help and very courteous. Anzil and his team at concierge very absolutely fantastic. Anzil suggested some great restaurants serving local delicacies. Although the breakfast was excellent with a very extensive spread the layout of the restaurant could have been better. The place seemed crowded. Maybe should have a bigger area for breakfast because with a full house it does become a problem."
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,Exciting experience. wood recommend the to all... Nothing to say...
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,I was very much Overwhelmed by the staff . They made us feel special . It was my anniversary celebration and they made sure that we feel special . THe property is utlimate and has alomst all the facilites wat a Hotel must have.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"My sincere compliments to the hotel team - they made our stay a truly excellent experience. Special highlights: restaurants (Table One, Kaema Sutra, Shang Palace), SPA (my wife was sooo happy), charming guest relations, cocktails at Horizon launge.  Nothing to mention - everything was simply perfect. "

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Modern, Classy, super finish throughout, stylish, comfortable, best hotel in Srilanka  A few of the fixtures in the bathroom didn’t work but this was a minor issue compared to the whole experience and compared to the other frankly substandard 5 star hotels in Srilanka "
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"good location ,clean and comfortable place. breakfast is good but if you order  omlet or hoppers you will not get it on time.We left waiting for an hour with out getting it."

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Nice view over Colombo and indien ocean and fantastique business lounge for extra cost but worth it.
shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,"The hotel is fairly new, the rooms are elegantly furnished and the facilities excellent. What stood out the most was the service. I had asked the hotel to arrange for a cake for my husbands birthday and they responded with a beautiful surprise, complete with a cake shaped towel tower, delicious cake and complementary wine! To make our checkin process smooth after a long journey, they arranged for an in room check-in, which was very convenient. Would definitely go back!"
shangri-la-colombo, 8.3 ,Rooms are not spacious and is only good for one person. Restauraunts are over pricing all items Room size and cost
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Lovely stay; excellent staff and great facilities. We staid 2 days and haven't left the property. Great location for as a family. The kids enjoyed the pool and we loved all the different restaurants. We loved everything
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Customer experience in the main hotel and the main restaurant was exemplary. Very personable and genuine. They went out of the way to make us feel special.However, I asked the house-keeping staff who came to our room to change the quilt covers (as my partner was allergic to feathers) to show me how to use the AirPlay functionality of the TV and he said he will call the engineering team to come to help me - they never came. Maybe the message was not communicated. The customer service at the Kaema Sutra restaurant was quite ordinary. The Shangri-la experience was not translated. They were all polite and nice but didn't feel as if they had any hurry to serve."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,The restaurants. The pool. The spa. The food. The service. Everything.

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,One of the best hotel WiFi connections I’ve ever experienced
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,The hotel was very new and really really nice. The most amazing thing about the hotel is the staffs who were extremely polite and helpful. During breakfast the chef actually came around to chat with us and asked if there’s anything else which we wanted besides the huge spread of food. My son asked for cheese dosa which was not there and they were happy enough to make one for him. We had booked 2 connecting rooms and had a late night flight so we asked if they can extend our check out for one of the room and they were very graceful to provide this for us. There was even a complimentary Tuk-tuk to take us to nearby shopping areas. The hotel is located opposite Gaulle Face & has amazing view. We will definitely come back & stay here again! Thank you for ending our 2 week holiday on such a positive note!  None

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,all good specially the Club Lounge and their service. Prem the manager and his team was very friendly and great customer service. overall a great property.

The room was also stunning, as was the view over the ocean. For the price, great value. Location was fantastic, can walk or tuk tuk to nearby shops. breakfats buffet selection was the best we have had in Sri Lanka . Highly recommend if you are visiting Colombo! Service in the pool area was lacking, not enough staff members for the number if people at the pool. Took a very long time for anyone to give us menus and we had to walk to the bar to place an order as no staff member noticed we were waiting to order."

We were allowed an extended check out which worked perfectly with our itinerary and Nothing was too much of an problem.  Not enough staff at the pool bar.

They gave us a free upgrade from lake view rooms to ocean view rooms on a high floor. They also gave us free late checkout when we told them that our flight back to Australia is in the evening. The buffet breakfast in the hotel’s Table One Restaurant is great. We dined at 3 of the hotel’s a la carte restaurants: Shang Palace (Chinese) - which has a wonderful ambience and the  food’s delicious; Kaema Sutra (Sri Lankan) - which has a nice ambience but the food is disappointing in terms of taste, portion size and price,; and Sapphyr Lounge - great for snacks, coffee and sweet treats. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again! Nothing major but it would have been better if the pool could be heated and the spa/jacuzzi  temperature less hot"

shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"It’s a nice Shangri-La. ultra Chinese construction so it feels very fake, the buildings exterior when looked at from the pool looks like an unfished project and the whole thing doesn’t respect or honour or do anything to fit into Colombo. Architecturally speaking. All the new developments aren’t so friendly to the eye."

Buffet was very tasty but above all generally friendly and attentive service at a high level. I did not like the fact that the hotel encouraged us to use the Shangri La car service which is of course way more expensive than regular taxi’s.
I also didn’t like how one waiter tried to get me to sign up for a loyalty card while I was enjoying drinks with my friend.
The location is ok but nothing special, a lot of industrial building going on."

Breakfast looks more like a Michelin star restaurant with a choice of 7 various cousins, all dishes are made to order. Super attentive, friendly staff willing to help with every request. We liked it so much so I re-booked my last night in Sri Lanka from other hotel to Shangri-La"

shangri-la-colombo, 8.3 ,"there is nothing to dislike in Shangri-La Hotel Colombo, 5 stars all the way. one of the cleanest, proper hotel in Colombo. The beauty salon was a bit small for the hotel size. but not a big deal. the treatment was nice."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"They up grade our room, which was nice. The buffet of dinner also very nice"
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,We were in a  hurry but the food was excellent your reservation person was not as good as we would have expected

shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,Overall good experience. All well as good.
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,The Kaema Sutta restaurant was really poor quality. However the breakfast and Chinese restaurants were excellent.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"I stayed at the Shangri-La in Bangkok several years ago and was extremely impressed with the hotel and the service.  I thought I would find the same in Colombo.  And I did. Some confusion at check in....  not a clear explanation of the pre-authorization charges,  The charge was quite a bit higher than the reservation had indicated.  No explanation of why.  Once I understood, it was ok."

"
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,The pillows and the bed were very comfortable and allowed me to enjoy a good night's sleep after traveling so far.  I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler wishing to stop off in Colombo for business. The breakfast had a lot of choices but the honey glazed pork was a bit dry and over cooked.  I wish it would have been a bit more tender and succulent.  I was really counting on receiving some excellent pork ham but my expectations were not exactly met for a hotel of this caliber.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"We like everything from the facility, staff, food and the room. Absolutely nothing."
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"The buffet in restaurant Only One at lunch and dinner time not so good guilty and not hot  all most evry things

shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,"Nice location, and it is as good as any other Shangri- La  We stayed at a 2 bed room apartment for a day and upon arrival we paid te entire amount . We were tired after our travel and we were resting, when all of a sudden someone was banging at our door. It was from house keeping , he had come to clear the mini bar as we had not paid a deposit . I felt this was absolutely ridiculous, as we have paid a substantial amount for the room, and upon check-out, the room will anyway be checked if we have consumed anything extra. I felt this behavior of the staff to be rude and unnecessary. "
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Where should I start from ... one of the best holiday I have ever been. Fantastic staffs so helpful and friendly 
Worth for the money specially room dining awesome foods and the services they give . Definitely I’ll book this hotel for my next visit . "

shangri-la-colombo, 7.9 ,"The fact that i paid for breakfast with my room.

shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very nice hotel with a five star rating. Certainly gives the quality feel and the staff are very friendly and helpful.One concern hotel is reluctant to provide market rates. On this visit hotel only had 30% occupancy where  all the other hotels were cashing with the high demand during this period .They were a large religious convention of 25,000 guests staying till the 13Sept .I ask the front desk if they can offer me a slight better room rate of one day extra.With only 30% occupancy I though you would not my hand off to offer slight bette rate .Ii payed $440 plus taxes fir two days ,I got a room at Kingsbury fior $140 inclusive of breakfast.They were 100% full but manage to get me a too. At a lower rate even when they were full.You lost out on customer who would have stay with you on my next visit.If you had given a better rate for that one day .Your hotel room rate policies needs changing .Especially with all the other hotels in Colombo were full .Regards Jaz"
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Rush to make customers happy.  Nothing
shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,"Service was exceptional and our apartment was very spacious for our toddler to roam around in. Hotel lobby was creatively decorated for Christmas, breakfast is a must and the wedding reception at the ballroom was unbelievable. A beautiful hotel with stunning views especially at night. Spa treatments were brilliant. Unfortunately there was unscheduled construction at a neighbouring property which kept us up at night however, this was beyond the control of the hotel. Maybe just inform guests when known, so one can adequately prepare. Moreover, their in person response was appreciated and the gesture of extra services was well received."

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Everyone we encountered from the doormen to the front desk staff to cleaners was friendly, polite, and helpful. It’s unusual to not have even one unpleasant encounter during a 3 day stay. Prem, a front office manager, was especially kind and attentive. The 2 bedroom apartment is a great value - beautiful, spacious, and well decorated. This is only hotel we love in Colombo. Nothing! Everything was fabulous - going back again in a few days."
shangri-la-colombo, 9.2 ,Very clean and comfortable. Had all facilities. It is over priced when compared to other 5 star hotels in the vicinity.

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"A very good modern hotel, with extremely friendly staff."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"The Shangri-La is the only place we stay in Colombo. We’ve tried Cinnamon Grand (terrible) and Cinnamon Red (3 star at best), Galle Face (tired), Hilton (bathrooms desperately need renovation). The Shangri-La is worth the premium price - staff, particularly Prem, a front office manager, is excellent and the rooms are well appointed. Service in the lobby lounge  isn’t great but that’s a minor issue and Prem took steps to address it immediately. "

There is also a mini chocolate cake which is very delicious, a fruit basket etc etc.

shangri-la-colombo, 8.0 ,"Location, restaurants, and the fact that it is connected to the mall. The hotel has one of the best sunset views in Colombo and close a lot of good restaurants and hotels. Hotel is new and is well-maintained and has become more secure (after the Easter Sunday attacks). Level of service of the staff is patchy and inconsistent. Some are great; others are really bad - and if you consider that you are paying good money you will be doubly disappointed. It was not a particularly busy time when I checked in but it took me at least 20 minutes to have everything sorted out. I had to go down and follow-up for my bags to be sent to my room because I have been waiting for more than 15 minutes - this is not the level of service that you expect from a Shangri-la Hotel."

shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"The service was impeccable, which is not always the case in Sri Lanka, so I felt immediately comfortable and relaxed. The room was clean, with everything we needed, including lovely toiletries from Ceylon Spa, and had an amazing view of the city. We enjoyed an a very fun night in the hotel bar, had food and drinks and were also entertained with fantastic live music, everyone was dancing by the end of the night. This was overall a wonderful haven in Sri Lanka, and a place I would love to return to. I can't think of anything!

the-oasis-ayurveda-resort, 7.1 ,Price was reasonable and location close to the Port where we were working. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Very isolated with few guests. This seems to be the general area at the moment as it was off season and not the fault of the hotel. 
the-oasis-ayurveda-resort, 8.3 ,"It was nice to have a pool ! The rooms where very nice and also the garden with all the monkeys was really cool :-) we didn’t do any Ayurveda treatment, was still a nice stay. But nearby there is not so much to do - we went from that place to Yala Safari :-) "

Plus the little walk to the ocean was nice, and watching the sunset was a bonus and had the huge beach to ourselves! We were supposed to get a free upgraded room, but we didn’t get it, plus the tv ( very old ) and phone did not work. When I told the manager he just said he knew...maybe they need to spend some money fixing these small things as the price is expensive and maybe not worth it for the rooms....but the outside area is really nice!"

I should say, the staff is pretty friendly and supportive. It is a hotel with lot of beautiful views!!!  Well for people who want television during trips, will be disappointed because none of the channels were working in the TV. But who cares, because I am not the type who watch tv during holidays. "

miridiya-lake-resort, 4.0 ,"Location was very good, near the lake. Very nice soothing view. Garden kept well maintained. Relaxing environment.  Bathroom had cockroaches. Washbasin waste outlet cap was missing, which made the room smelly throughout. Towels looked very old, discoloured and wasted. Buffet had very limited choices and the salads were over in no time. Staff in the dining area were not very cheerful and were not friendly. Service could improve more. Reception looked gloomy even during the day time. "

miridiya-lake-resort, 6.0 ,Location & staff. Bathroom was not good. 
miridiya-lake-resort, 10 ,"Initially,it was the first time we stayed at the location.When enter the room we grasped that, it is located in a tranquil environment,with a glamour view of the balcony.Room was up to standard and,the interior furnishings added a vibrant glam.Staff members including front desk,housekeeping,restaurant also the maintenance were extremely polite and, friendly .We well-noted that the front desk always ensured to give a satisfactory service,what we required,immediately they were sending to the room,even if we had any issue in the room.Further,the taxi service they arranged was super good.We supposed to stay one night and shifted to another property ,but as everything was really delightful we expanded our stay for more days.We tried the buffet twice ,but did not have many varieties ,may be due to the pandemic situation.Overall ,we can happily mention that, we met our expectations at Miridiya lake resort ,inspite of tiny issues.Highly recommend the property to everyone who wish to have a splendid stay during  Anuradhapura visit! Nothing much,we had to reach to the front desk ,by using our personal mobile as, the room does not have a intercom line."

miridiya-lake-resort, 9.0 ,"I stayed there while there were some covid restrictions. They were extra helpful and they always strived to take care of the guests to their maximum ability despite the restrictions. Super nice staff. Great location and view of the lake was very nice (especially at night). The garden was very well maintained and it was a very serene environment. The bathroom in the lobby area was poorly maintained, maybe it's due to the hotel restarting just after covid restrictions. The hot water in my room was not warm enough for me. Other than that cannot think of any issue."
miridiya-lake-resort, 8.0 ,"Excellent hotelExcellent facilitiesExcellent location We got set menu for lunch. The portion is not enough.Menu items for buffet were less than early three month ago.(This is our 2nd visit via Booking.com)"

miridiya-lake-resort, 7.0 ,"The property is located close to a lake and has an amazing view and the property garden is very nice. Staff is very friendly.  Breakfast was not up to the standard, French toast was soggy the bread and muffins are not fresh."
miridiya-lake-resort, 8.0 ,"Your menu for breakfast had included more country food like Kiribath, String Hoppers , Rotty, Manioc etc. These are our regular meals . It would have been a very much delicious B'fast, if some western type items like , bacon, Cheese, butter, Glass of Fresh milk and some fruits had been served. Anyway we enjoyed it. There was no Bar keeper and person who came to serve was not fully aware of varieties of liquor and prices. Also Price list not included every thing and didn't available certain liquor brands. the prices charged for Cutlery fish & Pork Bite plates were inappropriate and unfair (Rs.900/ each). When we were at Amaya & Anilana Hotels in Paasikuda, their prices were Rs. 1200/ for plate of one(1) kg of same items . It's too expensive for using Bar facility."
yala-village, 7.5 ,"The best part about this hotel is it’s proximity to Yala. We booked a safari (through a different company) and left at 5am to be one of the first in the park. We were incredibly lucky and saw 2 leopards amongst other animals. The hotel is truly WILD... there are elephants, buffalo, crocodiles, lizards, boar, birds etc all around and this definitely added to our experience of Yala. The rooms are great with comfy beds and the breakfast buffet was tasty (on par with other Cinammon hotels). This hotel could be incredible! The service is definitely not 5 star. They were out of so many wines on the list, we had to choose 5 before they had one and we were left questioning the ‘list’. The staff are not at all interested in the safaris... not once did anybody give us any info regarding tours / wildlife around the hotel and Yala Park. If they want this to be an experience the staff should be knowledgable here - after all, everybody is here to go to Yala on safari. The pool area is too crowded, despite the incredible views. The rooftop bar needs updating - we preferred drinking from the minibar. We also took a tuktuk to Tissa bus station and saw a cinammon hotel shuttle sitting at the station - would have been great to have been offered this transport as it’s a little out of the way."
yala-village, 8.8 ,"Amazing location, in the middle of the forest and right in front a lake where animals would come to drink and refresh"
yala-village, 7.0 ,Breakfast was excellent. Property is very earthy and blends wonderfully with the natural habitat. Customer service is very good and personalized. Loved the complimentary on arrival massage! Dinner seemed a scrap meal put together from lunch remains which was the only low point.
yala-village, 7.0 ,"Safari ,it s very good experience. And pool, Disconnect our wifi before check out"
yala-village, 5.0 ,Good
yala-village, 7.0 ,Good place. Nice staff! Food
yala-village, 7.0 ,"Breakfast is Western mixed with Sri Lankan great choice for anyone! Because of the covid 19 issue food is served to you on a plate so you can't get yourself.This takes time and some time down right irritating.Staff is a issue the middle management is busy with there workBut one bar waiter was great can't remember his name.Wish them all the success! Staff attention to guest is minimal"
yala-village, 2.0 ,"Location
Beach
 
Booked 2 jungle chalets - rooms were very small and dark. Sand and dust inside the rooms and outside sitting area and we had to clean the chairs before sitting down. No view. 
Diner and breakfast served in buffet style in main restaurant with staff in food stations serving food due to COVID-19. However there is no queue or serving system or entry exit points with everyone waiting everywhere to get served. They don’t  adhere to first come first serve basis when serving. I had to wait while people  who join after me being served first. Staff has no allocated food stations and everyone is running around. Had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a  croissant as there was no one at that station  and finally I left leaving the food on their display case. When asked they said they done serve bacon for breakfast."
yala-village, 6.0 ,"very good breakfastamazing location The room was not the same as in the fotos, They excused themselves saying that i was moved in another room because i was a alone female traveler. But they should have asked me before if i would prefer another room."
yala-village, 7.0 ,The location. The rooms. The experience Of being in a remote location The communication with the hotel. They never replied to my emails
yala-village, 8.8 ,"The hotel is in the middle of the jungle and wildlife is just around you. You can see lots of crocodiles, wild bows, deer etc. around the hotel. Apparently elephants also just walk around - but we didn't see any - may be because we only stayed one day. Staff is super friendly and polite - that is one of the highlights of the hotel.  The surrounding is beautiful and we definitely loved our stay at Cinnamon Wild Yala. Wish if we had time to stay there one more day. Nothing really - we loved everything"
yala-village, 8.8 ,"Pretty much everything, beautiful location, great staff. Wildlife all around. Rooms clean, dinner and breakfast buffet both really good too.  So far out of town that when tried to book taxi to the centre to move on we were offered one for 3750 rupees!! (And have travelled 2+ hour journeys for the same price) I spose the only downside of staying so far out! "
yala-village, 10 ,"The chalet was fantastic- such a different experience with mossy net around your bed and smelt like cinnamon- very cool- and very high standard of room and bathroom, with mini bar. A very well run resort with porters delivering your luggage too your chalet and picking you up quickly to escort you (when dark) for meals or to your safari Jeep. On safari we saw crocs, monkeys, deer, buffalo, birds, eagles....was worth then 0430 alarm for 0530 safari - we missed seeing elephants or leopards but 2 other tourists got the photos that we saw. Once in a life time experience - just do it !! Would have liked to see elephants or leopards but really best that they are in the wild and not in a zoo."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"The location is sublime; the wildest beach on one side and the National Park on the other. Am used to living ""in the jungle"" but this was a whole other level. The staff could not have been more helpful, friendly or professional.  Just came for a quick one night getaway, will definitely be back in the next few months for a longer stay. The wifi was tortuous. Tried four times to connect on my iphone and on the final attempt it said that I already had three devices connected! Given the remote location I don't see why it would not be more user friendly to just have open wifi - not like a passing elephant is going to piggyback on it..."
yala-village, 10 ,"We really enjoyed our stay at Cinnamon Yala- an adventure in the Jungle but with some luxury afterwards, and this didn’t disappoint. The setting was amazing, with the swimming pool only a few meters away from the water hole. The day that we didn’t safari we saw warthogs, crocodiles, wild boar and elephants all from the sun lounge! The food was lovely too and the breakfast buffet another highlight! We were delighted we picked cinnamon Yala for our safari accommodation. Only thing would be the cost of drinks and food- it would be great if there was more deals (like a happy hour, buy one get one free) or a slightly cheaper bar menu for light snacks."
yala-village, 10 ,The Jungle feel like experienced
yala-village, 10 ,"Exceptional under every respect, excellent staff"
yala-village, 10 ,"Great location
Exceptional staff - (especially  Mr samanatha and roshan from restraints) 
Great pool
Wild life 
Good Sri Lankan food Only thing that I would point out is it would be good if the hotel can provide an escort service to guests returning at night back to the hotel ( we encountered a wild elephant on the way in- though there are no reports of any attacks) "
yala-village, 10 ,A perfect place to be with the local wildlife. It is all around you. Even walking through the grounds. Amazing experience. 
yala-village, 10 ,it's very wild life to the people who love this he will really enjoy 
yala-village, 10 ,"Check in was smooth, rooms were clean and comfortable. Pool was great. Buffet breakfast and dinner was really good. I booked 3 rooms and they has already taken all the money from my credit card before we had checked our. Everyone wanted to settle their own bill! One night the buffet wasn’t on and had a bbq instead, we wasn’t made aware of this and the price for the bbq was way too expensive, but we went for a la carte and that worked out a lot cheaper"
yala-village, 8.3 ,"Amazing place to stay. Great facilities and located inside Yala National Park. The food and the pool also amazing We did the check out the night before leaving because we were leaving early. Without telling, they entered in the room to check what had been taken from the minibar and then lock it. We did not like this way of treating the customers at all. They had our credit card in case they had to charge extras from the minibar. This is something to be improved urgently... "
yala-village, 10 ,"During our honeymoon we had the pleasure to stay for two nights in the Cinnamon Wild Beach Chalet. From check-in to check-out everything was smooth as silk with very much attention to details and personal care from the staff, especially Roshan. Accomodation, location, pool area, food and beverage all with very high standards. Ofcourse don’t forget the stunning nature / wildlife. So, I would definitely recommend the Cinnamon Wild for future bookings and don’t forget to ask Roshan for a dinner at the lake, surrounded by crocodiles and elephants, fantastic. Hope to see you al again sometime.
Regards,
Anton & Berthe"
yala-village, 8.8 ,"Fantastic location, nicy swimming poolYou can see a lot of wildlife from the swimming pool The priceWatch out 30 % taxes extra on everything, this is not clearly indicated on the menu of the restaurantThe prices the hotel askes for the safari are extreem(Go to the entrance of the park and hire a jeep there for 10 % of the price)"
yala-village, 8.8 ,Amazing location
yala-village, 8.8 ,"Nature, location, the view of the lake, in wich you can see many animals, worth the stay. Staff perfect. Very good food and drinks and breakfast The price is very high, expecially if you add also the safari"

Reception and management could have been more accomodating when we faced some booking issues."
yala-village, 9.2 ,"Fantastic property just outside of the park set on a lake with plenty of wildlife in the lake and the resort.

yala-village, 8.8 ,It’s unique offering of staying in the middle of a jungle. Mud on the access path to rooms and the hotel
yala-village, 9.2 ,Nice being able to dine downstairs by the pool. The veranda attached to the cabin . The beach and watching the wildlife at the lagoon The lighting in the cabin
yala-village, 8.3 ,"A great resort hotel, with excellent staff. The wi-fi was terrible!  Frequent drop-outs and need to get new user name and password - not good enough for a property of this standard."
yala-village, 8.3 ,Great location for exploring Yala National Park. Wild is certainly an apt description as the wildlife are there in and amongst the hotel facilities. Great pool. Nothing. Loved our stay.
yala-village, 9.2 ,"Excellent stay in a unique place by the beach and in Yala! Amazing bird watching just by the pool, you don't even need a safari to see the wild life which is all around, including outside your chalet and on the roof! Rooms were excellent. Staff excellent. Buffet was excellent if a bit expensive. You are in the wild so you are a captive audience for dinner and drinks."
yala-village, 9.2 ,"This truly is an amazing place.  We saw almost as many animals at the resort as we did whilst on safari.  I had read the reviews about the food being expensive but it’s only expensive for Sri Lanka prices.  We enjoyed food and the restaurant staff were really helpful. 
The room was beautiful and clean. The pool was a perfect temperature.
The highlight for us was definitely being so close to the animals, monkeys and wild boar outside your room what more can you ask for.  We only stayed for 2 nights but we could definitely have stayed longer. The take out breakfast was very basic considering the price paid for breakfast. "
yala-village, 10 ,"We absolute loved every minute of our stay at this amazing hotel! That was the most beautiful hotel we‘ve ever been to. The bungalow was spacious and perfectly furnished, the bathroom was amazing, great shower. The garden is stunning: we saw wild pigs, chameleons, various birds, crocodiles, buffaloes, an elephant in the morning time and even twice a leopard! The service was absolute perfect, very caring and attentive people who enjoy working in this beautiful place, they care about animals. The food was very good (buffet). The pool is also very good. On our roundtrip we even wanted to go back to Yala and spend 1 week there and just enjoy the wildlife in the garden. The beach is very beautiful for a walk, big waves.We‘ll come back for sure!"
yala-village, 9.2 ,"The wildlife - the hotel has a ""waterhole"" where you can see plenty of wildlife gather, particularly at dusk. Can't really fault anything except thought food options were a little pricey."
yala-village, 10 ,"Staff were excellent and location was amazing. The room could have had more lightning, it was quite dark in the room. "
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Great location, we could watch many wild animals crawling all over the estate (crocs, monkeys, water buffalos, birds, wild boars, python snakes and many more. Being so close to nature was very fun. The hotel is located 30 minutes drive from the nearest city and there is no atm onsite and don't offer cashback. We had no cash on hand and could'nt pay our safari guide so we had to go all the way back to Tissa and that was not fun at all and was a big disappointment. Appart of that it was perfect."
yala-village, 10 ,"Isn’t easy describe the positive vibes and the feeling that this location can give you. The staff is great, lovely and helpful. We’re so shamed we’ve only spent a night. We’ve had a dinner by the lake and Rasham treaded us as royals. Had a little issue with a gecko in the room but it has been fixed in a second."
yala-village, 7.5 ,Location The bar facilities were poor with no atmosphere - not helped by television on behind bar.
yala-village, 9.2 ,"Staff were greatBreakfast was immensePool and view of waterhole great fun as we saw a lot of animals Annoyed that by booking early it meant I paid more than others staying there during that period."
yala-village, 10 ,"Excellent location, just 10 min away from the entrance of Yala National Park but actually the hotel is inside the protected area and we could see water buffalos and other wild animals. Rooms are spacious and clean. Buffet for dinner and breakfast is excellent. This was the best hotel we experienced in Sri Lanka. Excellent value for money. Water of the swimming pool was not very clean."
yala-village, 8.8 ,"If you want a luxury room in the middle of the jungle, then this is the place! Literally see wild animals of all sorts just walking around casually outside your cabin. Staff were friendly and rooms were spacious and clean Restaurant prices are ridiculously expensive for what it is. There are no shops for a long radius as you’re in the jungle, so its only expected they will charge such a high price as they can"

yala-village, 9.6 ,"Beautiful hotel - truly a special experience. The cabins were gorgeous and the pool area has a view of animals at the watering hole. We saw buffalos, birds snd even crocodiles from our loungers. The breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent offering both Sri Lankan specialities and Western dishes. All bookings should be at least half board as you don't have any other options. We had a few issues  with the Wi-Fi- you need updated codes every day."
yala-village, 10 ,"The location was brilliant, beach chalets were great to stay in. It is s very thoughtfully designer place with great staff. Definitely worth going. "
yala-village, 10 ,xx xxx
yala-village, 10 ,"Never had an experience like it. With animals walking past, you felt right in the heart of the nature reserve. The facilities were great and staff very helpful. We organised our safari through the hotel which was very easy to do. We also had an amazing and intimate dining experience next to the lake with wild boar, buffalo and crocodiles all passing by. Felt that breakfast should be included in the price which would have make it even more amazing, but this was extra."
yala-village, 7.9 ,"Good location, nice clean rooms Big resort feel, overpriced food"

yala-village, 10 ,"The beach was also lovely to walk on and lively relaxed feel, with animals trotting by the rooms! The only thing that wasn’t perfect was check in, which seemed a little protracted."
yala-village, 10 ,"The place is unique, all comforts are available, but you can’t forget the ultimate nature around you. We had monkeys on the roof and wild boars walking around the house."
yala-village, 8.3 ,Nature Dialog tv Cable connection 
yala-village, 10 ,"Location is perfect, clean nicely maintained rooms, staff are very friendly and helpful and the food quiality is great.  Nothing at all"
yala-village, 10 ,This incredible place is like no where I have ever stayed before. The pool looks onto a lake where you can watch wild buffalo and crocodiles (if you are lucky - elephants too!). The staff are kind and welcoming. The best part has to be the roof top bar where you can have a cocktail under all the stars. Stunning place. 
yala-village, 10 ,Every thing accommodation was excellent be among wild was fab . Nothing
yala-village, 8.3 ,I loved the location and the architecture. The rooms were a tad worse for wear and didn't feel totally clean - especially the bathroom (sink kept blocking up)
yala-village, 10 ,Beautifully set in Yala National Park  Wine was pricey 
yala-village, 8.3 ,Amazing location in wildlife park with fabulous views. As you would expect there are animal around the hotel site including wild boars and monitor lizards - you really feel at one with nature. Can’t think of anything that we didn’t like!
yala-village, 8.8 ,"The extra large rooms and bathrooms. It was very quiet in the rooms both day and night. There weren't enough sun beds around the pool. Meals from the bar took ages. The a la carte meals were overpriced, the service so slow. Much better value and choice in the buffet."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Location, the food was very good. Very nice staff, especially in the restaurant and the swimming pool. Amazing view from the pool and rooftop bar. Like the cinnamon smell in the room Lighting in the room, it is too dark."
yala-village, 10 ,"great location, staff and food massage was average"
yala-village, 10 ,"Wonderful, unique location. Brilliant to be able to see so much wildlife close by. Friendly staff. High quality and varied breakfast. Lovely curry for dinner."
yala-village, 10 ,We simply loved this place Food was excellent too Everything was just perfect
yala-village, 10 ,"If you ever go to Sri Lanka, this hotel is worth a visit. It is actually more than just a hotel; it is an experience. You are surrounded with the most fantastic nature and sooooo many animals. There is a lake about 50 meters from the pool, where elephants, leopards, wild boars, deers, monkey and waterbuffalos comes for a zip of water. While crodiles and birds is present all the time. It is amazing. The food is delicius and so tasty. So much to choose from. The headchef, Senaka,, and food&beverage manager, Naleen, made our stay even better. They arranged a session where we learned how to make curry prawns. It was so much fun. We actually did not want to leave; we felt so much at home. Every single staffmember was smiling and doing everything for the guest staying there. So if you are ever in Sri Lanka - do stay here. You will not regret it."
yala-village, 7.5 ,They really inflate the wine prices
yala-village, 10 ,"Fabulous place, very polite and helpful stuff. food was delicious. Great experience overall Nothing"
yala-village, 10 ,"Friendly and attentive staff. A great base for exploring Yala National Park and to relax surrounded by nature! We saw crocodiles, elephants and buffalo from the swimming pool...incredible! Would highly recommend to anyone."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Amazing place in the middle of nature with wild animals close by (although safe) and close to the National park. Super friendly and the service was absolutely amazing, good food options with both a la carte and buffet, nice and clean chalets. We loved this place and extended our stay twice. A bit pricey accommodation"
yala-village, 8.3 ,The location is great for animal watching by the swimming pool. All the food was excellent. The rooms really well equipped and comfortable.  Finding it hard to find something we didn’t like. I think it would be great to have filtered water fountain for guests as the amount of plastic water bottles is huge. Refillable bottles for guests would be a good idea. 
yala-village, 8.8 ,"Location is the best thing about this hotel, on the edge of Yala National Park. Many animals walking near the hotel objects. Nice pool, nice spa and massage. Internet connection, slow (about 1MB/s), and every day you must call the reception to reset the login counter. Yeah, they limit the number of devices online, and it doesn't work well."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Everything else !
The view on the lake, the food (amazing), the swimming pool with the wild pigs, the rooms so  nicely decorated, ... People could have been more helpful (a lot of them at the desk but it was difficult to have a coffee or to get a massage)"
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Great location close to the national park with beautiful viewWe forgot a pair of shoes and the hotel traced us and sent them via courier to our next destination Room a bit dark: difficult to read at night"
yala-village, 10 ,"The staff were super friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and comfortable, and had nice amenities. Someone from the hotel has to escort you after 6pm in case of wild animals. So many animals roaming around the hotel ! Loads of monkeys by the pool at night. Great view onto the watering hole by the pool, we saw an elephant there at night. The buffet breakfast and Mongolian bbq were terrific.  slight criticism is that the poolside A la carte menu was average (however the Mongolian bbq buffet  for dinner was really good !!). Also we did our safari tour separately for a lower cost. "
yala-village, 10 ,"Great location. Great food. Wild life very close. Monkeys in the reception area, real wild life experience I did not see an option to book the tree houses, otherwise that is what I would have booked, rather than just a standard room"
yala-village, 10 ,"Fantastic nature, lagoon next to hotel full of wildlife, everything on your doorstep, including crocs, wild boar, water buffalo, monkeys.
Staff very friendly. Rooms super clean. Huge choice at breakfast, we dined a'la carte in bar area, cheaper than buffet & much cooler. Room was dark so had to keep all lights on when in there."
yala-village, 10 ,Simple amazing! 
yala-village, 10 ,"beautiful resort , highly recommended"
yala-village, 9.2 ,"Room - big, clean, Comfortable with a great view Staff - helpful, kindwe can see wild life from our room. Cool"
yala-village, 8.8 ,"The pool was beautiful and the location perfect for spotting wildlife. Our room was perfect for our wilderness adventure. A good variety of food and nice cocktails. The perfect location for visiting yala, we had an elephant come to the pool at night and I shared the sun lounger with a water buffalo and wild pigs :-) The restaurant was unbearably hot, hard to enjoy meals, such a shame as such a beautiful setting but sweltering; much cooler outside than under the restaurant canopy but not an option for half board. The rooftop was a nice place to have a cocktail but needed a little bit of light for sitting there in the evening."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Beautiful location from which you see lots of wildlife from the pool. Great rooftop bar for sunset. Lovely chalet-style rooms, giving plenty of privacy."
yala-village, 7.9 ,"Location is unique, but be aware it is in ""the wild"". Nice restaurant with very tasty local food and also western / kids friendly food options.A very helpful travel desk arranging the highly recommended jeep safari but also good priced drop off transportation to Galle. I booked a 2 bed and a 2+1 bed. I  was charged for the extra bed, but realized upon arrival each room came standard with three beds, so I felt a little cheated.Bedbugs are common in most hotels in Sri Lanka, but the first rooms we got were very infested. However, staff was helpful to change our rooms. Even rooms in general are superficial nice and clean a frequent dedicated cleaning against bed bugs is recommended to hotel."
yala-village, 10 ,"Constantly lovely workers cleaning, very comforting owners :) nice atmosphere"
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Location, swimming pool"
yala-village, 10 ,"Perfect location to explore Yala NP! Lots of animals around, great food, fantastic staff."
yala-village, 9.6 ,I like everything except the swimming pool and its attendant. I did not like the treatment of swimming pool attendant. He is not friendly.
yala-village, 8.3 ,Setting and how close it is to the national park Expensive meals
yala-village, 9.6 ,"The bed was very good, nice rooms"
yala-village, 10 ,The experience of staying in the wild yet having a secure environment courtesy of the staff. The dinner and breakfast buffet at the restaurant was just fantastic.  Everything about the hotel and location was excellent. No complaints. 
yala-village, 9.6 ,The closeness to nature.  The staff were very kind.  The morning alarm was monkeys and grunting of wild pigs :)  No A la Carte for breakfast.  It would start only at 1030 am after the buffet breakfast.  
yala-village, 10 ,"Cinnamon Wild Yala Resort was our first stop on our Sri Lankan trip, we flew there in a small plane from Colombo to save time, it was an awesome experience!!!  Cinnamon Wild Yala Resort had everything so we stayed put for a few nights, enjoyed relaxing around the pool, the beautiful food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The bar staff were great and made some nice cocktails... there were animals roaming around and it was safe.  The staff escort you to and from your room because it is in the national park.  We loved the experience of being out in the wilderness, it was peaceful and interesting and our room was great, not too small, the bathroom was lovely.  It was a great intro to Sri Lanka, so grateful for the experience and would love to go back!! the sun lounges around the pool could do with cushions, lying on the wood was a bit hard but nevertheless we enjoyed it."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Great location, close to the park entrance with crocodiles buffalo and wild boar all within the hotel grounds, really cool. Nothing really"
yala-village, 10 ,"We had a wonderful welcome to this resort, with the elephant at the entrance and the moment we realised the elephant was from the wild we immediately took a turn and the staff escorted us to safety. What I liked was how truly it was a stay in the wild and the view of the lake with the wildlife added more charm to the location of the resort."
yala-village, 8.8 ,"Great location within the Yala national park
Excursion to Ridiyagama Safari park great
Elephants and monkeys visited the hotel and rooms
Great people, very friendly Jungle chalet room rates very expensive and no breakfast was included. 
Hotel discouraged kids as per hotel policies indicated in Booking.com
Yala park block 5 park did not have any leopards. Make sure you visit Yala park blocks 3, 4 and 2. Hotel will insist you do Yala blocks 1 or 5 but I suggest you skip blocks 1 and 5"
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Lovely comfortable rooms
Great staff
Lovely buffets
Relaxed atmosphere  Nothing "
yala-village, 10 ,"Very relaxing, great location amongst the wildlife, great food and staff."
yala-village, 10 ,"Excellent location for our safari in the Yala National Park; close to beautiful walks along the wild beach.
The rooms were very comfortable and spacious with comfortable beds. 
The service was excellent from the reception to the cleaning staff and the whole resort was professionally run. 
The food in the restaurant  was very good and the buffet breakfast was top class, with a great variety of choice.
The swimming pool area was a great place to relax after a safari, with lovely views over the lagoon where you could view crocodiles, wild buffalo and bird life.
Cinnamon Wild was a highlight of our wonderful holiday in Sri Lanka. A place not to be missed! Nothing"
yala-village, 7.9 ,"The phone always busy for calling ,miss two sunglasses,but no one support"
yala-village, 9.2 ,"Felt very much like a safari lodge! Beautiful pool, lovely buffet breakfast and lunch, friendly staff! The room was a bit in need of freshening up in places and massages and food was a little overpriced. "
yala-village, 10 ,"Foods were fantasticLocation is perfectSafari was amazingStaff are very kind and cooperativeThanks Dhanushka for the support"
yala-village, 9.6 ,Excellent location and amazing to have the wildlife roaming around the hotel site. Made going to the safari incredibly easy seeing leopards and bears amongst other animals. Staff were very friendly. Room was wonderful. Really all about the location with this hotel. Food prices were very high and you have no choice but to pay them or go hungry. 
yala-village, 8.8 ,"The staff were great, very helpful and friendly. I was hoping there would be a bit more animals around the hotel, saw some boar one day but no monkeys....."
yala-village, 9.2 ,"Very nice surrounding area. I couldn't book it through your site, but through booking.com. May be due to this reason, the cost was a bit more than expected."
yala-village, 8.0 ,Beautiful  location. The view from the rooftop bar was great. Arranging tours from the hotel will cost 3x the price.
yala-village, 8.8 ,Lovely location safari great Nothing much else to do one night would have been enough 
yala-village, 10 ,"Staff were very friendly and serve us in superb way. Room also was very comfortable and its being a really good experience.In Overall,the service that we got from there was amazing and extremely good. It would be better,if guests can have room service for food at least for breakfast and lunch as food delivering for chalet is not safe in night."
yala-village, 10 ,"Excellent location very close to Yala National Park. First animal sightings (crocodiles, elephants) are possible at the lake directly at the hotel.
Very friendly and helpful staff. Good food in the two restaurants. Clean and comfortable chalets, large safe to store all valuables. Nice pool to relax with the kids after a safari.
We can fully recommend the jeep safaris, which you can book directly at the hotel. We had excellent and experienced drivers and guides who tracked the animals very succesfully and gave us the opportunity to take good pictures."
yala-village, 10 ,"Staff very friendly, looked after us very well. Expensive honey and mud massage. My wife didn't expect a male to massage her as she had to warn him a couple of times as to be careful at certain parts."
yala-village, 10 ,The elephant passing by the pool
yala-village, 10 ,"Everything - the property is beautiful, the staff is super nice, the buffet is good.  I loved how much they care for the animals and respect the fact that we are in their home and not the other way around but at the same time take excellent care of the guests.  I will go back again.  
The only thing I didn't like was their pasta but then it's a very small thing and otherwise their good was good. "
yala-village, 9.2 ,We loved everything about this hotel. The staff were super friendly and they spoke great English!! The room was beautiful and we could see animals right outside of our cabin!! Would definitely recommend it!!! Nothing. Our stay was perfect 
yala-village, 9.6 ,Lovely pool area and great to be surrounded by the wildlife of Yala national park. Had a wonderful stay
yala-village, 10 ,Living in middle of the jungle
yala-village, 10 ,"Beautiful rooms, good service and amazing location "
yala-village, 9.0 ,"The staff were amazing - friendly and helpful. The buffet spreads were enormous and delicious. The room was clean, well laid out, spacious. It was nice that they also provided escorts back to the room after dark. And, the wild boar family roaming through the grounds just made it more fun."
yala-village, 10 ,Amazing tranquil place in the middle of forest. Wonderful staff especially Mr Prince. No such thing.
yala-village, 8.8 ,Very friendly staff.. awesome food.... nice location... it was superb.... Booked for 3 adults... but double room provided.. only 2 single beds ....
yala-village, 8.3 ,"great localization inside national park , lots of wild animals . road to hotel was terrible also  I was sick after a dinner :/"
yala-village, 10 ,"Our stay at the resort will be an unforgettable experience. The safari adventure started at the time of our arrival at the resort. Our room was amazing and very spacious! The room has a big balcony which allowed to relax in the middle of nature. The pool, bar and restaurant facilities were very clean. The staff was very polite and willing to assist at all times. Excellent buffet with a plethora of options for all tastes."
yala-village, 8.3 ,Safari Food 
yala-village, 10 ,"We loved it here. It’s amazing.  It’s not eco friendly at all
For a hotel in the National Park. They use plastic straws and have single use plastic bottles in the rooms which is disappointing 
"
yala-village, 9.2 ,Location and food They don’t up sell enough the excursions
yala-village, 7.5 ,Clean and friendly staff. You felt like nature was right at your door! Safari was a little expensive. Not much else to do there. Would be much better travelling with people or family.
yala-village, 10 ,The animals in the facility
yala-village, 10 ,"Wonderful place! We were looking for a hotel in the national park. First we wanted to book Wild Cost Tented Lodge but it was too princely. I we are very happy that we chose this hotel. We booked 2 beach chalets for 4 people. The rooms were spacious, very clean and good equipped. The chalets are built 3-4 meters above the ground. One of them was sea view. The territory of the hotel is very natural they tried not to interfere the nature too much, even the pass ways are not solid everywhere. You feel really in jungle. And the animals feel very much home here. There were a lot of wild pigs walking along the territory, they even came to reception and restaurant and they were not afraid, you can see rabbits and monkeys, squirrels. In the lake in front of the pool there are a lot of crocodiles and buffaloes. We also went for safari. You don’t need to expect to see something like in National Geographic films there, it is also not a zoo. So the animals are not waiting for you to come and see them. But were lucky to see some antipopes, peacocks and some other interesting birds and we were lucky to see several elephants. It was also very interesting to drive in a four-wheel drive in jungles. 
The breakfast were very good and the food in a beach bar was of good quality and very reasonable prices. A bit slow service in a beach bar"
yala-village, 10 ,"This is the most spectacular place to stay if you want to experience nature and wildlife with exceptional rooms, service and amenities. We stayed in the jungle chalets in the midst of wildlife coming from the Yala, right next to the most amazing beach for exploring. Waves are way too high to go in the water though. The restaurant and  lovely pool is located next to a beautiful lake full of wildlife, including a crocodile. It is close to the park entrance which is a plus. staff were always helpful and the breakfast buffet was great. Upon arriving we were asked if we wanted to have the special bar-b-que buffet at the pool.  We did. It was ok, but not great (some food cold, ice cream melted) It was also twice the price as the indoor buffet. And it was on offer again the next night, so not so special."
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Extremely friendly relaxed hotel with the safari & animals as it’s focus.  We felt at home immediately.  Lovely pool side facilities, a good restaurant with varied menu & a choice of either a jungle or coastal chalet. Chalet’s were very comfortable with a stylish but simple safari motif.  Altogether a very pleasant stay.  Wine in the restaurant was very expensive but that’s about all. "
yala-village, 10 ,"Incredibly nice, welcoming and charming staff. Nicely decorated and beautiful surroundings with lots of wildlife practically on the doorstep. We celebrated New Year's Eve here and were amazed by the amount of delicious food and the organizational effort of the whole dinner.  We prolonged our stay twice, because we like this place a lot! On New Year's Eve a waiter tried to persistently sell us a bottle of champagne for $500 using nasty methods like asking me in front of my wife if she doesn't deserve it. But this was a singular incident. The rest of the staff was more than welcoming and friendly. "
yala-village, 9.6 ,Amazing hotel. We had a beach hut which was suspended off the floor. The hotel is great if you want to do a safari tour in Yalla. Make sure you leave early to get at the gate first. Loved seeing all the animals around the park and this just added to our enjoyment. Lovely beach right next to the hotel where you can go for a nice walk (no swimming). Not much to do at this hotel other than the pool or go on safari. Having said that we only stayed 2 nights so that was plenty. 
yala-village, 10 ,"Cinnamon Wild Yala was built as a base for wildlife safaris but you could just as well lounge around for a day by the bar and beautiful pool as wildlife could be viewed at pretty close quarters.  We saw wild buffalo and the presence of crocodiles in the lake 100m from the pool terrace,  and a trio of wild boar strolled past our cabin one afternoon.  Wildlife aside, the resort is gorgeous, with beautifully fitted out cabins, a huge restaurant and a poolside bar / cafe.  Both dinner & breakfast were fabulous with a wide choice of dishes both western & Sri Lanka.   An air conditioned area displayed anything that needed to be kept cool such as salads & deserts etc.  A good selection for kids as well.  The resort is very child friendly.  But also very romantic if you're a couple.   Drinks on the roof top terrace was perfect for a cocktail under the stars.  Note staff need to accompany guests to their cabins after dark because of the presence of wildlife."
yala-village, 8.8 ,Design and location  A/C NOT WORKING WELL
yala-village, 9.0 ,"Excellent breakfast, good loction, and living with wild animals."
yala-village, 8.8 ,The location The pool could be heated as was cold at times. The spa was shut the whole time we were there which was a shame.
yala-village, 8.0 ,"Had a great stay here, wished we had an extra day to make the most of everything! Cabins were spacious, comfortable and quiet - at night we had a staff member walk us back to our room safely and we could see monkeys sleeping in trees, crocodile's eyes glinting in the lake etc which was cool. Pool area really nice, great views from rooftop bar, buffet food was awesome considering the location. Staff friendly and helpful. Note - you can order a packed breakfast if you are leaving early for safari. Our driver (in a sedan) was not able to drive us into the hotel due to the dirt road being in terrible condition. The hotel advised they were not able to assist in any way (no shuttle or transfer service), so we were stranded at the main road until we managed to hire a passing safari jeep to take us in."
yala-village, 9.2 ,The pool and bar were great. Could of easily spent our entire stay at the resort swimming in the pool. The food was over priced.
yala-village, 10 ,"Excellent hotel, facilities, location, breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff, highly recommended."
yala-village, 9.0 ,"We did find their Nature trail services excellent, we bought a full day safari in a luxury jeep and had the car to ourselves.  Our guide was eager to find us leopard and even extended the time "" in order to deliver "". We had a great time and believe it or not we did find a leopard crossing the road in  the driveway to the hotel.
 The presentation of the  packed lunch was so and so hence  this is an opportunity for improvement. It came as a surprise thar the hotel does not cater for vegetarians when it comes to a packed lunch for a full day safari. This is easy to fix.
The hotel being in the jungle means there are insects all around and difficult if not impossible to keep them out of the chalets without endangering the nature."
yala-village, 9.2 ,Lovely pool area over looking a lake with lots of wildlife. Close to the national park which is good for early starts for Safari. Food at the hotel was pretty good. Right on the beach  Spa was closed 
yala-village, 10 ,"Great friendly and helpful staff, beautiful property, nice room with rain shower, good food. Great value! Highly recommend and would go back! The only thing to say is that my shower ran out of hot water towards the end."
yala-village, 9.0 ,Food was excellent. All meals at the resort were delicious. They focused on serving local food which is great! it was right in the middle of the jungle so staying within nature was a soothing experience. We had booked on half board basis and wanted to change from Breakfast+Dinner to Lunch+Dinner. They charged us extra for this change. We would have greatly appreciated if it was done without a charge.
yala-village, 9.0 ,"Breakfast was a huge spread including lots of local dishes, pool was lovely, wild animals roaming around close to Yala NP for safari trips. One of the best showers we had in Sri Lanka.Nice bar with sunset views over the lake. My other half booked me the Dine in the Wild experience which was reallylovely and our host for the evening was particularly good! We booked a safari with the hotel and did get to see a leopard! Staff were very helpful but the process of check in etc was a little slow. They did not have the room we booked due to an issue with one of the rooms, so downgraded us, but they did refund us the difference for having a cheaper room."
yala-village, 8.0 ,"Location was extremely cool , exactly inside yala natural park , wild animals walking through hotel bungalows made this place amazing. Atraction ""Dining in the dark"":Amtosphere and place - amazing , super cosy , arround burning candles , aligators , trees etc. I can strongly recommend this place.Food - disaster.... it was so bad that I can not explain it. I completely can not understand idea of it and why it happened. How it is possible that I fly 7500 km from my home and recieve food made by the same cuisine but in 10times worse way. Why this beautiful hotel with wild spirit can not serve local dishes but try to serve something from european cuisine??? Honestly - I should recieve refound fot this dinner......"
yala-village, 7.5 ,"The hotel is right next to the national park and is in a brilliant location for safari, even from your sun lounger you can see buffalo, crocodiles, boar. It’s pretty impressive. The buffet breakfast and dinner was good, gluten free options were ok and the chef explained to me what I could and couldn’t have. 
The beach is just behind the rooms, you can’t swim in the beach but we had fun looking at all the animal tracks and enjoying the impressive beach front. Drinks were very overpriced compared to anywhere else we’ve stayed but you are a captive audience so they charge what they want. One of the guys that takes the luggage to our room was very rude when we first arrived for no reason. He then continued to mutter something every time we walked passed. A big contrast to all the other staff who were very friendly and helpful. "
yala-village, 8.0 ,Staff were super friendly and welcoming. The location was incredible. Our driver stayed in the driver accommodation and got his wallet stolen. The food was very average.
yala-village, 10 ,The staff were really friendly. The food was good. The location is perfect for going on a safari and we were able to see lots of animals roaming around the grounds! We would highly recommend the safari lodges.  Nothing! 
yala-village, 10 ,The property blends with nature.  Crocodiles swim in the lake adjoining the property.   The buffet breakfast and dinner were exceptional considering the remote location  None 
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Everything was more or less picture perfect. Only minus, and the only reason for not giving a full 10/10, was the spa was being renovated during our stay, which meant no spa or massage - which were some of the reasons we chose Cinnamon Wild in the first place. No info about the renovation on neither booking.com or Cinnamon Wilds own website - which is a bit unprofessional. It would have suited a four star accommodation to be upfront with this relevant information."
yala-village, 10 ,Beautiful apartment right in the reservation.  Movement of wildlife in the evening :) very good eating. No entry into the ocean.  Strong currents and waves
yala-village, 9.0 ,"The location is in the middle of the forest, right by a lake full of crocodiles. It also has a viewing deck. There is also a beach within 3-4mins of walking time. I have never experienced such a wholesome experience. Just the last 300 meters of the road to get to the property was unmade. There is nothing that the hotel can do about it."
yala-village, 8.3 ,"Loved the jungle chalets, the swimming pool , the food was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly. We had read previous reviews about the access road and would agree that it was extremely difficult to negotiate! We felt sorry for our poor driver but he did make it!"
yala-village, 8.0 ,"The choice on offer for both the buffet breakfast and dinner was quite impressive both in visual impact and choice but it was interesting that over a three night stay the quality of offerings was quite variable. It didn't seem to matter how full the restaurant/hotel was either. For the first night of our 2nd stay there was a wonderful sushi selection but the next two nights what had been left was recycled into less desirable offerings. You do wonder if  instead of having such a huge choice that certainly impacts on the eye, maybe sometimes less is better ?As we were booked in on an inclusive D,B&B basis which was already paid for we didn't investigate the a la carte dining area or the B-B-Q offerings but I did not that the latter was on offer at $30 per person which when compared with the average price you'd expect to pay for a substantial meal in most restaurants was les than $10 per person but they do have a captive market. Beware! The alternatives are not there.The hotel merits it's 4* rating but it's not an exceptional 4* hotel by any means.Hence 8/10 = 4 stars whereas I can happily give 10/10 for lesser rated places who far exceed expectations. Having stayed previously I knew what to expect this time. As mentioned in my appraisal from the previous stay a week before, the grounds are very disappointing.For the majority of visitors that probably doesn't come in to consideration, for true wildlife enthusiasts it does.Most guests appear to only stay a night or two, perhaps take a half day safari with the aim of seeing a Leopard but have little interest in most other species. What they are helping to create is an unregulated park with speeding vehicles and ""leopard jams"" queuing for a glimpse. Because most visitors it seems have little desire to extend their safari beyond a few hours the onus on the jeeps is to satisfy their clients as quickly as possible and the chaos will always be there.Take a full day safari and the difference is huge. The Block 1 part of the park is very quiet between the hours of 10 and 4pm, although you will be spending a couple of hours parked up on the beach having lunch."
yala-village, 8.0 ,"Lovely, stylish cabanas and beautiful, well  maintained grounds and pool.  Friendly staff.   Checking in took a bit of time as staff initially couldn't find our booking. Low lighting in cabana."
yala-village, 8.0 ,"The whole hotel complex is in a beautiful area with crocodiles in the lake, monkeys and wild pigs passing through the complex and at times wild elephants on the beach. The staff were great and the food was fantastic. The park and the wildlife are stunning however there are so many safari vehicles that the trucks were overtaking and racing each other at 50kph down the tracks to be first in the park. The queue of trucks waiting to see a leopard was around 500 meters long, all with engines running and creating pollution that guests were breathing while waiting. Our driver was very surprised when we asked to go a different way to see other parts of the park and avoid sitting in traffic for up to 40 minutes but made a big effort to get to other areas and avoid the crowds. We did hear a leopard calling just off the road but never saw it as every time it looked like coming out more trucks drove past and scared it away. I'm sure with a little thought and cooperation from the Safari companies the experience could be greatly improved both for the visitors and for the animals."
yala-village, 9.0 ,"I stayed at Cinnamon Wild Yala on several occasions and I absolutely love it! It is very close to the main entrance of the Yala National Park and the their Nature Trails company offers brilliant safaris with excellent drivers and nature guides. Best chances of encountering wildlife are, however, during full-day and afternoon safaris. The morning safaris tend to be a bit disapppointing if one isn't too keen on panoramas and birds. The rooms are very nice and the bed is very comfortable. The food is also very good and varied. On this occassion I arrived after my wallet had been stolen and I was, therefore, unable to instantly pay my bill. The staff were exceptionally understanding and friendly and allowed me to call a couple of days later to pay with my new card. This definitely made this unpleasant situation much more bearable. Staff are always so incredibly friendly! I'll definitively stay here again. I can't really think of anything!"
yala-village, 9.6 ,"Great facilities, generally attentive staff. Good food choice at breakfast and in the bar Disappointing internet connection and staff not particularly bothered to sort it out which was frustrating as I needed to keep in touch with my work.   Two hours after a power cut was resolved they were still blaming the power cut.   
Alcohol significantly over priced.   We booked a hotel organised safari and had great trouble to get a bottle of water to take with us. Managed to get water after nearly 10 minutes of negotiation 
"
yala-village, 8.3 ,The location near to Yala and a comfortable stay with a nice swimming pool The high prices charged for excursions and wine in the restaurant - higher than comparable places in Sri Lanka
yala-village, 10 ,"We were really happy with every aspect of our stay at Cinnamon Wild, from check in to check out nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The rooms were fantastic, and we were able to book our Yala National Park and Udawalawe National Park safaris direct from the hotel. We had a group of 10 and nobody wanted to go home! Roshan and the restaurant staff were fantastic, and even helped us arrange a birthday cake for one of our group!"
yala-village, 9.2 ,"The staff were amazing, always helpful and with a smile. Good choice of food, good value. Lots of activities. We stayed one night only so didn’t have time to explore  Driver accommodation was provided, our driver complained of insects and bed bugs "
yala-village, 9.0 ,"Great location, Very near the National Park entrance. The chalet was lovely.  The staff were very friendly, The food excellent. We tried the buffet one night - a vast choice and of high standard, and the other restaurant the second night - again high standard. We booked a safari through them and again were very pleased, The guide was knowledgeable and sympathetic to the animals.He really did his best to make sure we saw everything getting us to see a leopard at the very end when he could easily have just left the park. I would definitely recommend"
yala-village, 9.0 ,"Chalets were spacious & comfy, amazing food (Specially the Breakfast Buffet), very friendly staff. "
yala-village, 8.3 ,"Great location and so surreal being surrounded by wild life in the jungle. 
The food was amazing with a huge amount of options. The rooftop bar was stunning and breathtaking to sit outside and listen to the wildlife.
Location wise if you plan on doing the safari, it’s a must visit hotel. Facilities! Considering you are in the jungle with little on your door step, there wasn’t a huge amount of facilities, and it was the only hotel with no entertainment.
It’s a hotel catered for the safari! If you don’t plan on doing the safari visit, it may not be the best option. "
yala-village, 10 ,"Location ,closest to yala national park"
yala-village, 8.8 ,"I loved the natural feel of the cabin placement - and the cabins themselves.
I thought the bar was a great hang out space but the staff can’t quite work as a team.
They do have a few good bartenders though.  
Nicely kept pool & great pool staff.  Also very good house keeping.   The spa was closed for the entire week I was there and that is one of the amenities I was looking forward to.
The front desk staff was not helpful in helping me make arrangements at any nearby lodges who have spas.
It was January which is during busy season!
"
yala-village, 10 ,"Unlike many hotels in Sri Lanka at present, this hotel is reasonably busy. The staff are friendly and the facilities are far better than I thought they would be, being slightly away from civilisation. The room was superb. They think of the little things, like having a modern iron and ironing board in the room, and lovely cinnamon scent in the bathroom. The staff appeared happy, and are very agreeable to talk to you, and give you their views. It is not every hotel where you experience the thrill of seeing wild boar and a wild elephant walk through the grounds. The Nature Trails staff are trained wildlife experts, and you can learn a lot from them if you are interested in looking and listening. You can walk to the beach, but it is a steep shelving beach, and the sea is much too rough to swim in."
yala-village, 8.0 ,"The location (although not easy to reach) is amazing, you are sleeping in the middle of the jungle, just next to animals living in the wild. Also the place is located close to the sea, so you have both safari and beach in our place. It is really special. We got a nice deal with safari included in the room price, and the hotel organised a safari trip for us.  And the food in the restaurant is really good. Book room with full board. The place is really in the middle of the jungle with the last few km off the road, so you better come by SUV or a solid car. Otherwise, it can be really hard at the end to reach the hotel. Our room was very dark and very few little lamps could not lighten the place, so basically you are a dark room."
yala-village, 10 ,"Superb location, friendly and great hotel staff. The elephant was came near to our chalet in the night and that's a wonderful experience. Highly recommending this place."
yala-village, 10 ,"We were really happy with every aspect of our stay at Cinnamon Wild, from check in to check out nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The rooms were fantastic."
yala-village, 8.0 ,dinner is not as expected. the taste is so much like foreigners prefered. dinner and the size of the  room. Pool also did not open until 10 am.
yala-village, 8.0 ,Breakfast and dinner very good. Entrance way is narrow. Wi-fi connection very slow
yala-village, 10 ,"I loved the isolation close to Yala national Park & a short walk to the beach.
The room was like a very upmarket jungle lodge very clean & modern. 
The food is yummy & so much variety!
Having the safari included was fantastic & on the early morning Safari saw 3 leopards at 3 different times completely amazing! Very lucky! When I arrived in a tuk tuk the staff weren't very interested in helping me & just told me to sit on a very uncomfortable bench around the corner & wait!
I had been on public transport for 3 hours & thought I would have been nice if they at least offered me a drink on arrival!
I guess they aren't used to an old lady arriving in cheap transport at a 5* resort.
So I told them that my money is as good as anyone elses & I could go elsewhere!
I said I wanted to sit somewhere comfortable & I would like a drink!
I wanted to look at the room first before I booked
Well all of a sudden they treated me like a guest showed more comfortable seating & brought some drinks!!"
yala-village, 10 ,The location is perfect to get away from the city. The property and the rooms are designed beautifully. The pool is overlooking a stunning landscape. The staff was so helpful- this made all the difference!  Pool closed early (5pm) due to Covid-19 precautions. 
yala-village, 8.0 ,Like the location and can feel the real wild life and the food also very good and have a traditional touch with Sri Lankan cuisine. Staff service is good. Had a issue with online booking and payments. Think that it is just a random error. Some staff members need to be train for curtsy calling but I would say not all.
yala-village, 10 ,Ond of the best hotels that we've been to. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice location and ambiance. Chalets concept was perfect and cute. Loved all the slogans they used to convey the messages.so touching and felt like home.  Ond of the best hotels that we've been to. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice location and ambiance. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Price for a 5 Star hotel
Swimming pool 
Breakfast spread 
Furniture 
Accessibility  Very positive. Hard to fault. 
The bin in the washroom doesn't fit in. It's a bit tall for the setting. The power points are not sufficient. Yes the room has 3 sockets but not placed in correct positions for a business traveler who may use multiple devices. The marketing Manager Mr.Vivek was not able to be contacted for 2 full days including via his mobile and left messages at reception. Initially he offered us corporate rates but we found booking.com cheaper even with added taxes. Thereafter he has not responded. We could still smell Cement in many areas. They should do a freshing-up. The sitting area besides the reception is too dark."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The infinity pool 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"The pool is nice. We asked for a high room when we booked and got the third floor. Many facilities are missing like sauna and steam room. Really it’s just the pool that’s nice. The adjoining mall isn’t really a mall. Staff is very cold and extremely slow moving. You can request something four or five times to your room before actually getting it. We ordered a taxi to the airport the night before we were meant to travel. The hotel couldn’t even arrange that properly. It was over twenty minutes late, and delayed even more because they couldn’t communicate with each other to express whether or not we had paid for the taxi. We missed our flight. To “accommodate us” they gave us 3 hours longer to check out. That’s it. They even made us pay for our taxi back to the airport the next day despite promising we’d go for free. They were not interested in fixing the situation or having us leave happy - all they wanted was more money."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The location was nice and the staff were excellent. There was a water leakage from our room on the second night and it was like raining from the ceiling. On the first day we only had hot water and while we asked the room boy he said that we didn’t know how to use it, however it was not the case, since the water leakage started after we complained again about the water. The staff attended immediately and changed our room after the water leakage from ceiling. The whole room was flooded. After that the experience was excellent and the staff was nice as well.

Very thin walls, I could hear every word spoken by my neighbour in the next room and all his telephone calls as well as being able to closely follow the plot of the TV programme he was watching despite wearing headphones in an attempt to block out the noise. This gets really old by 1:30am. This is not a hotel I would ever return to if I wanted a restful stay and a peaceful night sleep2. The hotel oblige you to pay a charge at check in 'to cover expenses' then also insist on giving you a formal bill for the cost of the whole stay on checking out. So I was double charged to my credit card account. This is a bit of a scam. Charge me at the end of my stay or arrive at a final bill from which the money I have already paid on check in has been deducted, but to charge twice, while the staff reassure me falsely that this is not what's happening, left an incredibly disappointing taste in the mouth on my return home, made more so by the fact that when I emailed the hotel to query this on checking my statements when I got home, they refused to reply. For these two reasons I am sorry to say that I would not stay here again"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Breakfast was nice. Also easy access to main tourist attractions in town

marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Swimmingpool on the roof is excellent, the rooms are very comfortable as well. Price/quality-wise there's no reason for any complaints I guess, but it all feels a bit sterile....without any character. Breakfast and dinner in the hotel were disappointing. For sightseeing you need to take a tuk-tuk...the hotel is a bit too far from the city center to my opinion. Check-in was awful: the hotel demands a deposit of 50USD at check-in...as such they made a reservation on my creditcard of 350USD: the price of the room + the deposit. For the room I paid 247USD, that leaves 103USD for the deposit. That's plain out rude to my opinion. When i told the receptionist at check-out that i wanted to pay in cash he told me that it takes approximately 40 day's before the creditcardcompany would release the 350USD reservation on my card, ""so better to pay by creditcard anyway"", I was told. Very rude."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Facilities and Amneties  3 times booked recently from my end and twice on behalf by my friend. But all times were less fortunate to receive sea facing rooms. Overall good with facility and amneties wise. Soft skill coaching  required to staff, for improvements. "
marino-beach-colombo, 3.3 ,The gym had lots of great equipment but there was a member of staff there who was using the equipment while we were there and then sat there and stared army female friend making her feel very uncomfortable until her husband asked him to stop. It was very inappropriate and unprofessional. They also restricted us to 500mL of water each.   
marino-beach-colombo, 3.3 ,"The rooms were clean. The pool was nice.  There were many hidden costs with this hotel. A lot of the staff were unpleasant. They were very strict about access to the pool and using the pool towels, we felt like we were being monitored. The access cards frequently stopped working. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The location it was very convient
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Perfect for a one night stay when you arrive from the airport if you are heading south. Dinner restaurants not great, we got greasy western food not exactly what you expect when you arrive in Sri Lanka"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Pool is great, the service was outstanding"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Staff were very friendly, facilities and room was also nice. However my stay was absolutely ruined by the hammering and drilling which woke me up on a Saturday morning from the floor above. I phoned 4 times to get them to stop, finally being told they'd stop in 20 minutes. Totally unacceptable and really did ruin the one night stay I had there. Otherwise it would have been great. Received no compensation at all for being woken up on a Saturday morning by hammering and drilling in the hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"BreakfastNew furnishings (recently opened) First room noisey (banging from above) - took one and half hours to move us to a new room. Front desk manager did not sort it personally as he promised.Walls not insulated well, could hear adjacent rooms TV. TV built in unit acted like a sound box.No Hotel information available in the room or on the interactive room TV."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,it is good hotel taxes
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"The pool was amazing It did not feel like a 5 star hotel,never mind a new one.Very ugly exterior and dated looking communal areas and rooms.Ridiculous system requiring key cards for lifts,pool etc which often failed to work meaning repeated trips to reception in wet costumes to ask for help(no apology) or lifts just stopping and all the lights going off.We hoped we would feel really pampered here but it’s the worst 5star hotel I’ve ever stayed in.Sri Lanka is an amazing country with some beautiful hotels,both new and old but this is definitely not one of them.We thoroughly regretted our choice,asked to change rooms as our sea view was of a building site and this was met with indifference even though the place was very evidently not full"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Fantastic roof top infinity pool.
Super buffet breakfast and dinner with views of the ocean and passing trains. Lovely room.  Jacuzzis were broken for 3 days. Reception staff were rather slow at check in and check out. "
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,"The hotel looks nice and new. The infinity pool on the roof is awesome.  The overall stay was horrible. We booked a full sea view room as stated on booking.com. When we got to the hotel we asked again to confirm and the staff acknowledged that the room is a full sea view. When we got to the room it wasn’t and the staff refused to change it to what we actually booked and did not offer a refund for the difference in price. Complete ripoff. 
The staff at the restaurants don’t know the menu. We ordered the burger which said on the menu it has mushrooms came with no mushrooms and extra bacon added. It was no surprise that they didn’t change it. The waiters kept running back and forth to the kitchen. To “ask the chef what’s in the food”
Additionally we ordered room service at 10pm, which arrived at 11.30pm. The food was incomplete, cold and bland. 
All in all the stay was less than expected. Would not recommend the hotel"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Good service, clean rooms, beautiful pool and view from the pool  Very noisy, location very busy not recommended for vacation time, expensive, the buffet not recommended for European people( very spicy and no variety), breakfast on the other hand was very good

marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Clean rooms, lovely rooftop bar and swimming pool/ jacuzzi. The food from the restaurant was not nice at all and paid nearly £30 for a meal me and my friend did not enjoy but were forced to eat as no restaurant nearby!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Overall the hotel room and bathroom was very clean with having a beautiful view from the balcony. The only problem was having a very hammer like noise in the morning which have disturbed our sleep a lot and when I complained it at the time of check-out they even not bothered to apologies from us.
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"We felt staff lacked hospitality and we didn't like couple of dishes which we ordered. Overall I would say when you ha 've other hotel in the city centre it's not worth paying the same amount and staying couple of km away from the centre"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Good Bed Drilling and Hammering
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Bed was comfy. The food, while abundant, was infused with a lot of sugar and other meals not so appealing. Apparently the hotel was only three months old but it looked at least 2-3 years old. Also there was no spa set up as yet. Gym was very good and the pool outstanding"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Excellent view of the ocean. Lovely breakfast spread. Very friendly and helpful staff. Easy to move around with well priced hotel cars. The noise of the trains and the traffic on a work day can wake you up early, even in a seventh floor room."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The infinity pool was incredible! Could have stayed there all day. The rooms are spaceous and there‘s a big selection of tea in the room. The location is good with many nice restaurants and a mall close by. Overall, the hotel felt more like a 4-star hotel to me, in terms of decor and bathroom cleanliness. We didn‘t try the continental breakfast as it was quite expensive and there was a nice breakfast place close by. Cocktails by the pool were not so good and pricey."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"the Hotel and the staff covered my expectations. The room was fantastic and very clean. The stafff were very helpfully all the time.I hardly recommend it"
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,"Majority of the service staff at the morning breakfast. Very nice and polite.(no sarcasm here).  It's a very expensive motel.
There was no cozy feeling. You gotta hand it to the check-in staff."" Very warm and welcoming"". If I wasn't tired and ready for bed already, I'd have just walked out.. "
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Cleanliness of the hotel. The infinity pool was superb. Very slow check in
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Front desk held us for 45 minutes on check in because we had an offer for the hotel which meant overall we paid 6 dollars less for breakfast. Several times they asked us to just pay the full amount even though we had an offer. I said a few times that we were tired (arrived at 8.00pm after a very long journey) and we were leaving at 6.00am the next morning but front desk still held us over 6 dollars. For an expensive hotel I was very surprised over this attitude. Eventually they escalated to a manager, and then to their manager. Soured our stay. After, not even an offer to take our bags to our room."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Location Staff behavior and hospitality 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Rooms where wonderful, and spacious. Pool was great. And service around the pool felt very nice. Check-in was horrible. Rude service. In the bathroom of the room there is no cover so there is see through when you shower, go to the toilet and take a bath. Can’t understand why they won’t have a cover for bathroom."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"The reception staff is very slow and not courteous at all. A bit rude and not cooperative at all. Unpolite."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Huge bonus is swimming pool. On the roof. Long and nice. Quite good gym. Reliable WiFi.Breakfast is various. Quite new. Cleanliness is good, but could be improved. Expecially public zones. Checkin was super slow... checkout even worse. The hotel is good option for overnight stay. The staff is nice, but not very professional. For the price you pay one would expect better service. The staff at checkin had poor English and did not provide information we needed."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Mold in the shower stall.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The room was good, comfortable and clean. We ordered from in house dining once and the food was reasonable for the price. I'm going to list these down in points because there were quite a few that i was very displeased about:
1. I don't think the receptionists or anyone at the hotel for that matter know anything about hospitality. The managers were fine but other than apologizing, they didn't really do anything to help us. Read on to know more.
2. When we checked in we were asked if we'd prefer to put forward a deposit towards any services we would use during our stay. The alternative was to pay as we go by cash/card which is what we chose. Fast forward to the next morning when we tried to get breakfast from in-house dining. They refused to take our order because it was hotel ""policy"", apparently effective on that very date, to not take orders from any guest that didn't put forward a deposit. We spoke to at least 5 different receptionists & managers who couldn't come up with a solution for us and they themselves seemed a bit confused about why in-house dining would not take cash/card on delivery of our food. This was stranger because we had ordered the previous night and paid by cash. Talk about change in hospitality overnight!
3. During my second day at the hotel, I decided to step out to the balcony to have a cigarette, take in the view and sunshine. It was a particularly hot day too might i add. 5 minutes had gone by and my fix satisfied, so i decide to move back inside. But to my surprise the balcony door was jammed. Yes jammed! My wife tried calling for help 3 times for people to help and no one turned up. My wife had to walk out to the floor and get someone to open someone else's room on the other side for me to jump over the railing (i know right?) to the other balcony! Thank goodness I wasn't travelling alone!
Look, in reality this could all be really bad luck but as a guest you should NEVER be put in this situation."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Great shower, comfortable bed, excellent breakfast and breakfast wait staff.  Good WiFi.  Nice view Check in took half an hour due to too few staff.Our luggage was not sent to room.  I had to phone twice before luggage was finally delivered.  Apparently staff were confused about which was our luggage despite having an identity tag.We requested a quiet room but were placed next to a family with small noisy children and a blaring TV set.  Again I had to phone twice before any action was taken to address the noise issue.  Thank you to the lady staff member who called me back with follow up information"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Room was comfortable. TV was large. Bathroom was good. View from bedroom was awful. Staff were snobby when we booked in.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Location Poor communication about deposit payment and refund process to guess.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Beds were comfy.Good clean rooms.Gymnasium was super. i booked a sea view room as mentioned in the booking.com.But it was partial sea view with terrible city view.I think booking.com has done the mistake.So i think that place was not worth for the amount of money i spent
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,The location is really good but the problem is that I even can't use my visa on the pos of the hotel...I have to take cash with my visa..

marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The room was decent sized and clean which was impressive. Also, there were complimentary items in the minibar. The house keeping staff were friendly and would greet us every time they saw us. Service was bad. There were a lot of staff hanging out in the lobby but didn't seem very keen on greeting the guests or offering help. There were separate queues for check-in and check-out (as per the signs) However, when I got in the check- in queue (as the check-out queue was long), I was told by the staff to get in the other cue with a blank face. I would have expected a warmer welcome while checking-in the 8:00pm. While spending some time at the lobby I also noticed that a few guests were complaining to the staff."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Friendly Staff nice facilities Food too spicy for our Western Palat but that is not the Hotels fault
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,I loved the clean rooms and pool The location.

marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Location was not bad and the rooms were spacious and clean  The room service menu was extremely limited after 11pm
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"If you're lucky enough to get a sunbed, the infinity swimming pool is very nice. Beautiful gardens on the rooftop as well. Hotel is fine, but  for a 5 star hotel, one would expect more.  The check in experience was a mess. Worst check in experience out of our entire stay in Sri Lanka. The staff seems confused at times, not the 5 star experience you would expect. The swimming pool is amazing, but is not suited for such a big hotel, only a small percentage of the guests can use it and you need to go there very early in the morning to get a sunbed. "
marino-beach-colombo, 3.3 ,The pool  The Staff 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"The staff was helpful and attentive, we recieved  an upgrade of the room upon arrival. The pool are is nice. This is not close to 5 star hotel, although the facilities are ok, the food is below average( we tried breakfast and room service).  I found location not very convienent, a bit far and not accessible by foot.( from the sea side)"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Very clean, and the pool is amazing. Worth the stay for the pool Staff were slow and didn’t help.
Poor service overall "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Nice room. Clean and tidy. Like a ordinary business hotel. Check-in check out took to long time. Long ques of guests waiting.
marino-beach-colombo, 2.9 ,"Worse staff, train will wake you up. "
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"The room was spacious and the bathroom was good. Lack of proper staffed restaurants.  The roof top bistro was appalling both with the food and the service.  Took ages for even a coffee to come out, never mind any food.  We once waited for nearly an hour before anyone told us that they didn't open for another half hour.  Also they had no tea! The waiter said they didn't have any tea bags. In Sri Lanka that was an atrocious thing to say, especially when the hotel owner owns a tea estate!  The Chinese restaurant was good though with excellent service."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The pool is stunning and the beds are very comfortable. Ample breakfast opportunities. Staff is very attentive. Photos are misleading, the rooms are smaller than one might imagine.I believe this hotel is on the expensive side of the spectrum"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Great stay for transit through Colombo, nice hotel, great pool and gym facilities and breakfast is very good! "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Best hotel we booked for around the 120 usd per night. Not much for a tourist in columbo though Expensive drinks
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Didn't understand the logic behind depositing an amount of $50 if we had to order something in our room.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,Very comfortable bed Attitude of staff.  Delay with room availability despite arriving 1.5hrs after check in time.
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Some of the staff, the hotel itself was ok There was no real direction from management it’s a very amateurish run place which is unfortunate as someone has spent a good amount of money building it. It’s a big hotel with only 3 desks shared for arrivals and departure. I waited 20 mins to check in while other staff watched on, very badly designed!  Restaurants were sparse and like a school cafeteria with bright lights, no warmth at all the feel of a cheap holiday camp.  Wine selection was poor food buffet ok but rate it a 5. They need a good GM and need to re design the restaurants then it would be a far better product."
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,The brekky was awesome. 2 days stay without geyser working. Repeated request to no avail. Table lamp not working. Aircon malfunctioning. Room door defective making alarm noise bcos not shutting
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Check in is awful, our room was not ready at 4pm - there was no urgency from anyone behind the check in desk dispute other people complaining - this left a bad taste in our mouth for our 5 night stay.Pool is great, the main attraction of this hotel.Breakfast is ok - its a free for all so very busy unless you go before 8.Location is ok, theres no beach but we wasn't here for the beach.Room is good, view was amazing but there was urine on our toilet seat before we even used it - there was also a tiny lizard in the room but we put it outside.Room service was good but there were several black short hairs in my fries.Wouldn't come back here to be honest but was ok.. There is no customer service."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Extra comfy rooms, helpful service. Great Buffet.The rooftop pool was incredible. room service was slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 3.8 ,"Spacious room.Thats all. Otherwise it is a very bad hotel. Took 1 hour to check-in, very inefficient, long line-ups at check in & checkout. When I booked, I was informed that 30% tax is included in the price, only to find out during check-in that it was not. I was so close to booking Shangri-La but didn’t because 30% tax was the only difference and I thought it was a lot.Room was nice and spacious. View was a whole different story. It was partial sea view and the other view was construction site everywhere.  No way you could enjoy the sea view due to the construction site.It was New Year’s eve and we went to their new year’s eve buffet, it was way below average. The space was tight. Guests were attacking the food like its their last time eating. We went to this hotel because of 5-star review. This place is bumped up due to local guests. It is not  even close to 3- star by international standard when it comes to the facilities and service.  My kids and husband went to the pool and got out within 5 minutes because the pool was filthy. I had to pick stuff out of my son’s hair and we left the water guns at the hotel, that’s how filthy they got.Below average breakfast.  It is a local hotel, charging 5-star rate when services are not even 2-star. They hve the same rate as Shangri-La and such poor service and insulting staff.  The hotel does not have its own reception when you call the reception for help. Call goes to a call centre where you have to specify the location you are staying at. We asked for a late checkout by 3 hours. That was denied right away saying that he hotel was fully booked. I went to the hotel website to see if it was full, it was not..!45-minute line up at checkout, because they were going to each room and counting their towels and everything before checking out. Yes, they were counting to see if the guests stole stuff from the room. I know it is common for the staff to check mini-bar, but doing inventory of the entire room and making the guests wait – ridiculous."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Big resort type hotel perfect for a stopover. Pool looks a lot nicer in the photos. You pay for what you get !
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The swimming pool was great with a great view. Also the Chinese restaurante that belongs to the hotel had delicious food. Male employees were too intrusive with us, asking always many personal questions that made us feel very uncomfortable all the time. "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Nice pool Location and there is NO beach!
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Great beds, spacious rooms. Good selection for the breakfast buffet. Pool looked nice but we didn't get a chance to use it while we were there.  Hotel was very clean. The restaurants were lacking in atmosphere. Food in the evening buffet wasn't very warm. Overall feel the hotel is expensive for what it is. Beach isn't one where you'd want to swim in the sea as it's right by the railway."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"We had one of the five rooms per floor that overlooked the sea and had a balcony and this was fabulous.  The staff were as helpful as their training allowed.  Breakfast was superb.  There was easy access to malls and food courts, and the city centre was a short taxi ride away. This hotel reminded me of the ""5 star"" hotels in China: it was nice, but it disappointed on the details.  We had to ask for our room to be serviced.  They wouldn't take Debit cards for some reason.  A lot of the staff didn't know the layout or available facilities.  Many seemed to think that using their phone was more important than paying attention to a waiting customer. The sign asking for an ""additional $50 a day on your credit card so that you can best enjoy our facilities and enable us to better serve you"" was either amusing or insulting.  The balcony was really dirty.  The bars sold CANS of beer and provided plastic glasses...  hmmm..."
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"DISAPPOINTED
Dear Friends Please Don't Use Your Credit or Debit Card in this Hotel and please don't gave your card to this hotel...
Please If anything pay through booking.com or Cash payment...
Hai
I am Kugatheeban
My booking name KuGa TheeBan
My booking confirmation no is 1663441102
21st Friday December i was checked in your hotel (7th floor Room no 736)
I used my credit card to paid for your charge.. For the beginning one of your staff Miss.Chalinee who was checked in my details and told me that they blocked the money 80000rs for the 3 days room accommodation 60000 + another 50$ for additional payement that use by me during the time for an advanced.. And also told me that, after checking out, they release the additional payement as the same way how i paid..
So first they blocked the 80000rs. (I got the confirmation message from my credit card centre, that 80000 Srilankan rupees was cut from my card)
Then the checking out time on 24th december i got the total bill amount is 64183.05rs from your hotel. One of your another staff checked out on that time and told me to the balance account will automatically come to your account within hours..
So this is the story...
But till now i didn't get the balance payment from you..
The next day of my checking out on 25th december i noticed that i didn't receive the balance money. So phoned to your hotel on 25th and someone answer and told me that i can get the balance within 2 days.
After two days on 28th i used my card and got big shocked, because of my credit card balance is -56755.49 amount..
Again i checked with my card centre, they said 21st December 80000/= cut from my credit card to marino beach hotel and again 24th December also 64 183.05 cut from my credit card for the same hotel...
After that i phoned to your hotel 28th December evening, someone talk to me and  said an irresponsibility answer. That is ""OUR PEOPLE ARE BUSY NOW, CAN YOU CALL AFTER 10 MINUTES?"
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,early check in for international travelers. better customer service as there are many options available for travelers .
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The rooftop of the hotel is amazing with an infinity pool, a nice bar and a green area to hang out. Good breakfast. You can hear everything in the next room. It was really difficult to sleep. Also, there is a nightclub/hotel next to this hotel and you hear a very loud music until midnight."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Breakfast and room Staff services.Check in and check out process is very slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"Pool was great. Chinese restaurant was good. The high tea was disappointing.  Staff do not understand simple English. Housekeeping staff need training. The  duty manager, Julian and transportation duty head Suneth have poor integrity. They offered a free airport drop off but said that there were no vehicles. As we were waiting outside we saw a hotel car returning and the driver said he was available. When we asked the Manager he said vehicles were available but he had no drivers, yet the driver told us he did not have another trip on his schedule!!!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,SwIming pool and food No access to beach and night club from hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Room and the swimming pool The location and staff attitude
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Good value. But crappy location if you want to eat at some of the hipp resturants Colombo has to offer. The resturants at the hotell is rulles with russians and people in full body black dresses.. not worth it. The breakfast is good tho. Couple, Mid 20s, norway. Resturants"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Restaurant 😛🥵
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Hotel super,stuff helpful and friendly. Breakfast buffet  excellent. Swim pool fantastic. Highly recommended  Nothing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Lots of staff but none were helpful. For example check in took 15 mins once served 10 min q. Booking ataxi to the airport 15 min q then i apoke to one of the 4 guys in the lobby not behind the taxi desk and they came and helped.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Booked a room for the two of us ""room for 2 people including breakfast"". However it was pointed out that Booking.com booking was for a room up to two occupants but only one breakfast, VERY ODD As above"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Top notch facilities. Tasty foods at breakfast time, you should totally try their WAFFLES 🙌🏻 Booked for 2 people but only got breakfast for 1 person, not 2. I complained and there was no action from the staff.
Room was only cleaned twice out of 7 nights! Eventhough I’ve let them know to clean up my room. Appalling service"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"The infinite pool on the roof was amazing, its location to Galle Rd was good.  In the pool area, their were waiters but nobody asked if we wanted a drink or actually made us feel welcome at all. 
It was nearly all men working in the hotel we saw one woman. As a women on holiday it makes one feel self conscious. Especially around the pool. 
All the glass in the rooms and balconies were dirty and smeared and could do with a good clean. There was a major building program going on and for us as guests. If they had thought of our  comfort and view they could of moved us to a room with a better location. The hotel clearly wasn’t full. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The rooms are clean and comfortable and the rooftop pool is lovely
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Most liked: pool and garden at rooftop and really super helpful and friendly angel at guest relations desk Dilshani. Hotel owners seems had purpose to do luxury hotel, but actually luxury are details, but here are many fails:(( and so many details turned not to luxury, but to kitsch. There is tiny line between this, and designers failed here. Also, generally hotel is clean, but again, small dirty in the bathroom, not cleaned balconoes and very dirty balcony door from outside... "
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"Check in experience woeful - ignorant front office staff fiddling with the screen and chatting Collegues whilst there is a massive queue.Staff knowledge and service- horrible. We were stopped and bullied at the breakfast counter demanding payment where we fully paid breakfast for 2 as part of the rates! At the live cooking counter you are asked to go to your seat with a promise to bring the omelette or hooper to your desk but it never arrived or the wrong item was delivered on almost all the time! It was a wind up.Airconditioning was not working and there was no remote. Room service staff had no clue how to operate. We were left to boiling under the quilt.Final straw was when the iron they had left in the room left a stain on my wife’s white dress just before we were planning a night out!All in all it looked the like the majority of the staff seemed to have been hired on a someone knows someone basis without any experience or calibre of warm hospitality you’d expect anywhere else you travel in Sri Lanka. Service (none existed)"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Good location Not very much welcoming
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,The location only  Room is too noisy and the costumers service not helping me to change the room ، i thing they Racism with the Arabs because I saw how They deal with other nationalities really I got choked I will never ever come back to this hotel . 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Friendly staff Notting
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The breakfast and meals were very good. The staff pleasant and accommodating The check in procedure
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Bed and deluxe room was really good and clean. Staff was not service minded, check-in and check-out took up to 1hour. Male reception staff at this hotel talked so low that is was close to impossible to hear what he said."
marino-beach-colombo, 2.9 ,"Fantastic infinity pool on the 10th floor.Excellent buffet breakfast"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"The only interesting thing is the pool which is absolutely amazing. 
The room are great but the view from the 3rd floor is awful The lack of service for a 5 star hotel. They are sooooooo many that it seems unbelievable to struggle to get something basic like a drink around the pool or having them move one sunbed for you. 
They are not smiley at all and working in such a hotel is not only about the pool. Taking care of your customers as we experienced greatly in Sri Lanka is very important. 
The buffet is impressive with choice but with absolute no taste !!!! When you ask the cook for stir fried vegetables at the chinese corner, it’s badly done and obviously against their heart. "
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Pool was amazing Rude customer service at reception by Chalani, who would not budge with any requests even though I had been a regular customer. Very rude and laughing and speaking in another language with colleagues. Zero manners compared to other hotel staff around the area"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Pool and rooftop Chalani from reception was rude and lied about some requests
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Service at Cafe Checking In and Checking is dreadful took over 20 mins to check out with no queues
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The infinity pools, The gardens on the top of the roof. The Gym.The bathroom design. the hotel design, and how close it is the to shopping mall(Marino mall).The hotel location is really good and located off Galle road where you can find anything and everything is a walking distance. The bed's mattresses are a bit stiff and not comfortable at all. Room service is very slow, and they do not follow up to check and refill the used items or change the towels unless you called requesting to do so."

marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,"Location, roof top swimming pool My stay this time was below average.
The personnel are new and without any training in hospitality, no good morning, no good evening, when u are passing before them, they just stare at u as if you are from another world.
After check in waited for 20mins for the luggage to arrive at my room, had to make three calls.
The front desk manager gave me night club voucher of 500 rupees without knowing that the night club was closed by the hotel two days back.
The restaurent is a big canteen and noisy, for 250+ rooms only two restaurents. 
It is certainly not a 5 star hotel, i would rate it as 3 star hotel.
Stayed for the third time in 8 months and can see the quality going down. I will think twice next time before booking in this hotel unless they improve there quality of service."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"1. Swimming Pool.2. Value for Money. Services."
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,The pool is great but very dirty. They know people eg tuktuk are scamming and they don't warn the customer. The location is dodgy. The scammers are waiting ready for you
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"One of the Front Office Manager argument with us ,, we made a booking through Booking.com i waited at lobby more then 1hour no body reply to me as well as they talk to us in indecenti will update the Front Office Manager  photo for your view and make sure to avoid this issue for your all"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"allways we have to wait front office  more then 45 minute , dont care about the customer"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Great breakfast! Room was not cleaned during the whole stay, although I specifically asked for it three times."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Breakfast Noisy rooms
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Fair  They deny the reservation even after I approved to them they not apologize 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"The room itself was pretty basic, what one would expect from a 5 star hotel.  The atmosphere in the lobby and hallways is very majestic.  The rooftop pool and jacuzzi is a nice touch as well. The room had a balcony that overlooked a construction site and an astroturfed top of a couple buildings.  Very disappointing view.  On top of that, the door to go in and out from the balcony was very difficult to operate.  My fiancée couldn’t close and lock it without my help and she had a hard time getting the door open when it was locked as well.  Because she is a smoker, this became a constant issue.  The shower lost water pressure only 2 minutes into my shower and would come out hot as a dribble or cold with pressure, so I had to complete most of my shower with cold water.  The most disappointing thing however was the Chinese Restaurant.  My fiancée is Chinese and we went up and asked them if they accept WeChat and/or Alipay because we were trying to save rupees on meals by paying in Chinese Yuan electronically.  The hostess said that they accepted that form of payment, so we reserved a table.  When we went up there that evening, excited to have some good Chinese food, we were greeted with a double disappointment.  Not only did we find out that their chef isn’t Chinese, but we also discovered that we were lied to and they don’t accept WeChat or Alipay.  The funny thing is that every Chinese restaurant we went to on our trip, whether it was Chinese or Sri Lankan owned had the ability to take these forms of payment.  So why was a 5 star hotel so limited?"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The view of the ocean was awesome. Large balcony where you can sit for hours. The infinity pool was very nice. No beach! Staff could be more hospitable and prompt.
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,The rooftop pool and bar and the view. Nice sunset from the rooftop. Bathroom was not well clean.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Location n the comfortable luxury room. Incredibly slow n poor staff service.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The infinity pool here is fantastic, one of the nicest I've been in and sunset was amazing!The pool bar and restaurant in general are reasonable price-wise and the food is very good too.The facitilities onsite are good as the hotel is over a shopping mall and there is also a spa and various balls and restaurants.The Buffett breakfast was wonderful with loads of really good choices. We had the buffet dinner one evening and that was equally as good. The staff which we dealt with in the varies locations were really helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, the room let us down.We had a really tiny balcony which overlooked a building site but the balcony was filthy with dirt and dust when we arrived (I understand this is like from the building site but it certainly had not been cleaned in a while). The shower had loads of hair in the drain and we kept getting an odd smell in the room as well.We were advised we had a free daily mini bar which we thought was such a lovely touch (it includes three soft drinks, 2 water, peanuts and biscuits - which we found lovely). When they cleaned our room on the first day, these were not replaced.These are small points but these are the things you would expect in a 5* hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"We were only here one night so can't comment on much but there is a beautiful swimming pool on the roof with fabulous views, go at sunrise (6.30-7am) for a peaceful swim (or photo op!) as it gets pretty busy later. Excellent breakfast with vast choices. Not sure how close it is to local amenities as we stayed here as a stop off before travelling on to next destination."
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,The hotel location The service is very poor
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Breakfast,  pool,  gym Had booked two rooms but were allocated on different floors"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The Breakfast.   It was truly awesome.
The room was also good
Dangerous little step down into the bathroom They forgot to clean our room one day
The pool while great was always crowded with many people being fully clothed.
It is a huge facility and the reception is like a banquet hall.   Causes it to lose some character"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,"Room was really nice, as was general building very fancyBed was comfy WiFi was very slow (does not seem an island wide issue)Bath was very slow to fillService and quality of evening buffet was poor. Food was luke warn at best, meat was chewy and was not offered drinks/asked if anything else I needed. I asked if the service charge could be removed from my bill and was told that was not posible and had to be paidWas woken up twice by them trying to clean my room on day of check out. Stayed in expensive place to help with jet lag, considering I was checking out that day see No reason why people should be knocking and entering roomFinally was not asked how my stay was at Check out to raise these points. Really nice facilities but was let down by service you would when staying at a nice place. Would suggest training regime is reviewed"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Strong chemical smell of decoration remains
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,I only stayed one night and was okay Hotel is ok
marino-beach-colombo, 3.8 ,Pool. Good. Room. Bed.  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Good breakfast. They had a lot of options The shaving kit in the room is supposed to be for onetime use. Mine was cleary used by someone else before. You couldnt see it first, but when I washed it, long hair with wrong colourcame out!And nobody did our room."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,A lot of noise from ajoining room
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The position, view from the bedroom and roof top pool. The food was also of a good standard.The roof top pool and leisure area with real grass area was very good. There was a nice mall directly below the hotel with some good shops and nice coffee shops where people watched the sun go down at night. The service in the restaurants was good but a little inconsistent i.e. you had to ask for more coffee and tea. At reception there seemed to be quite a few trainees needing help to provide the correct answer to enquiries. One minor point in respect  of cleaning; in the bedroom there was a glass topped table which had not been cleaned. I did not like the mattress covers which seemed to stick to the sheets."
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,Junior staff are good but management is terrible.. Really affected our trip. Never again.. There was no hot running water in the hotel room. Could not shower.  Terrible manager Ravindra Prasad essentially said tough luck nothing we can do about it -  he would buy us coffee or tea at reception. Still paid full price for the room even though we could not use it. Ravindra Prasad came up with different stories tried to lie about the reason for the hot water interruption and blame it on our check out time! 
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,pool on the top building view outside
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The pool is spectacular many weeks ahead of our trip I emailed the property to ask for adjoining rooms as we have young kids. I was told the hotel does not have adjoining rooms. When we arrived we found adjoining rooms but non were available. This was a big issue for us and negatively impacted our stay and our view on the quality of service provided.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"It’s good location, swimming pool view and food was excellent  The room what I book from Booking.com i did not get. I mean room facilities. "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Rooftop I checked in and I had to wait almost 40 minutes in my room to get someone bring my suitcase when I told them that I needed to change and was in a rush.
They gave me wrong key and was trapped out in the corridor. The staff made an enormous issue and looked at me suspiciously as if I wanted to go inside a room that wasn’t mine. It took 10 min to give me a key that works while I was waiting in the corridor."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"The facilities The room given was a different than shown in the pictures . No tub , No sofa and minimal other furniture .... this room was probably meant for a handicapped person 😟.... not sure why it was allotted to us ?also some staff attititude needs to improve"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Waiting time to get the room was a hour late than the posted time. We had to stay in the lobby until the room was ready.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"the location. check in staff were nice. well, the rooms look and feel rather cheap. no privacy out on the balcony. some of the staff are clueless, takes ages to get something done like bringing a new room keycard when we were locked out because of keycard malfunction."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Front Office staff - ladies are very friendly. The gentleman are all grumpy face and think they know it all. The concierge team is friendlier The short man with a bow tie in the restaurant during breakfast service. He wasn’t that friendly and have attitude problems to me (I have Chinese face) and lead me to another sit with a poor reason. On the other hand he was very friendly and pleasant to other guests (Caucasian) and allowed lead them personally to the table and allowed them where ever the guests wanted to sit. I have observed at least 30 minutes. This hotel is super double standard. However, Shangrila Colombo gave me totally different experience when I was there for dinner, as their staff are friendly and I was very impressed with their restaurant. Maggie/Service Manager was very professional and taking care of me. The Executive Chef came and say helllo. The staff are super effiicient and friendly. If I come back to Colombo next time, this hotel will be my first choice."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,They asking for advancement payment of 50 USD for each day.
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Good hotel on beachfront. Stunning rooftop with pool and good bar service! Beautiful views over the ocean and city.  Feels like it’s overbooked and not that well run. It says it’s 5* but it felt more like 3* 
It was too busy and crowded, didn’t feel as nice as it should have for what you pay for. Memorable due to the view none the less, makes up for impersonal service"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"Room was big, clean and well eqipped. Staff did not seem to know what they were do or what I was doing."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Great infinity pool. Perfect end to the holiday. Very good breakfast. Felt quite business like, a lot of groups of men. The music round the pool was also very repetitive and annoying!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Pool at the top  The reception staff not friendly (particularly one guy) like everywhere else in Sri Lanka 
Not much going on at the hotel. Made a mistake with anniversary cake and have a 31st birthday cake instead "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Relatively expenssive for the quality of the hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,Nothing at all  Location and unfriendly staff 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,pool...room comfort...location...staff courtesy didn't accommodate late check out
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Amazing staff, facilities and food! The value for money is fantastic. Lovely welcome by all staff and choice of food is very good. Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"New hotel, everything functions as intended. The staff is courteous and makes you feel welcome. The room is kept very clean. The breakfast has lots of variety if you like Lankan cuisine. Hotel offered a free transfer from the airport in exchange on booking.com and insisted on payment (usd 20) when I arrived. Most dishes offered for breakfast are local i.e. super spicy, variety is very limited if you have European taste. Some of the room design choices are very uncomfortable and outright strange (a walk-in shower BUT a step to enter the bathroom, glass wall with electric curtain between the bathroom and the rest of the room...)"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Roof garden was nice, as was the pool. That’s the biggest selling point of this place. The rest is pretty average for the price being paid  Be aware, booked a double room, hotel took two passports to check in. Then at breakfast it is only included for one guest. Manager did fix this after a long conversation. Our next hotel told us this is a new thing many hotels are doing in Colombo
Also, Having a signature plus room and then to find it was a connecting room, with Zero option to change. No option given by the manager so had to listen to the conversations of the people next door.
Better options around. Movenpick looked far superior.

marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"The breakfast was superb! It could not have been better. The location is good, it is easy to get from the hotel to the airport or vice versa. The hotel seems very old fashioned, even though it should be quite new. It smells like cigars on the hallways and the carpet is not clean. Overall the decoration is very old fashioned. The pool was HOT! So it is not refreshing at all. It is also impossible to get out of the hotel without taking a tuktuk or a taxi. No way you can walk around. And the restaurants nearby did not impress us."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Staff Never refill stuff without saying
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"There was a varied buffet at breakfast. Room was comfortable and modern. The walls are incredibly thin, you can hear everything happening on your floor and the two floors above.There aren't many spots in the shade by the pool, so be prepared to miss out."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,out side location very bad. because its like a village. and all the rooms are very small. location. and i stay there i didnt fund the pool asked everyday from the staff they saying not showing.
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"We had pretty a bad experience with this hotel and we would definitely not recommend them or stay there again. We accidentally left an expensive pair of headphones in the room. When we noticed and called the hotel a few hours later they checked lost & found and said they were not there. They said someone else is already in the room so they can't check again. They assured me that there was 'no chance' the headphones were left there because they would have '100%' been found and returned. There was no possibility that housekeeping missed them, or that the cleaning person kept them. ""They have policies against that"". So we were rudely told they were simply never left there. Several followup emails directly to the hotel were completely ignored. Do not trust these people.Also, don't believe the hype about the breakfast buffet. It is indeed large, but it's only medium quality food."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,The check in took forever
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The restaurant waiting staff, chefs and food were excellent. The hotel is a few months old and there were multiple snagging issues being worked on during our stay including electricians working around our feet fixing decking lights while we were eating dinner in the evening. More critically, the Spa was closed during our entire stay because of an issue with the flooring. Having paid over £300 a night to stay in a Spa hotel for my wife's 50th birthday, we were deeply unhappy that this wasn't available, there was no notice provided, and when we raised all of our concerns we were told there was nothing they could do to maybe lower the price as the booking had been made through booking.com and commission had to be paid.
Reception staff seemed inexperienced, when we went to reception to enquire about tours we were for some reasons assumed not to be residents and told tours weren't available to non residents. Once this was overcome we asked about getting a car and driver and were put off twice because the right person either wasn't available or was in a meeting and the promised follow up call never happened - so we ended up doing our own thing independently.
When we raised issues about electricians working around the restaurant terrace while we were eating, and outside our bedroom late in the evening, and also  the fact the spa was closed without notice, and directly asked for a compensatory offer were just refused. We paid over £600 for two nights and feel like we've been massively taken advantage of hugely disappointed about what should have been a special stay for my wife's 50th birthday. The hotel is not worth more than £200 a night."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"We just spent 6 hours in the hotel so didn't have time to like anything but the location which defined our choice to spend our last night in Colombo. But it was enough time to dislike the flashy, functional, impersonal decoration and ambiance in the lobby as well as in the room fitted with the most stupid bathroom separated by glass wall and doors!!! and more importantly a king bed which I didn't find comfortable (too hard) and which mattress appeared to be protected by a plastic/vinyl sheet having an unpleasant feel and being noisy at every move. This hotel seems to be targetting a type of crowd which I am not a part of...."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Infinity Pool Want to specifically mention Mr. Firzaad Dawood. Absolutely arrogant with no experience of customer understanding. 
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,"Pool on roof.  I booked room with complement mini bar, the hotel management empty the mini bar and keep few items only (soft drink, biscuit) but to compare the real mini bar many items are missing (picture attached) 
There wasd disturbing from railway which exactly passing front of the hote. Also area is too pother du to mall in same building.
To visit SPA you have to leave the building to other one and take many lifts. 
Breakfast main course is for Asian and every day same menu.
The pictures showing beach but actually you can't go to the beach beacuse there is road, train railway and rocks."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"location, facilities, staff"
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,The staff and activities during the new year  Balcony had so much cigarettes buds and looked disgusting 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"The location is good and also it’s a big thumbs up for the pool in the rooftop. We always order food in the hotel but it’s always not hot even if we especifically told them to bring the food hot. The wifi connection is very bad, they bring us 2 router bcoz we keep complaining about it. Incase you want to eat something for example ice cream around 10:30 am, they will refused to serve it and they will tell you to wait until 11:00 am bcoz they keep saying that it’s not allowed to serve it for breakfast. Whatever food you want that is not on the breakfast menu, they will not serve it. Usually the hotel serve bread basket for free if you order food in the morning but we are very astonished that they are asking to pay for it. We order food everyday in the hotel and it’s annoying that you have to repeat 4-5 times for the food you order before they can get it. They always forget to replenish our water and cupboards everyday, we have to remind them everytime for it. And some drivers doesn’t know the location or can’t even speak in english. We used our phone for the gps and guide him for the location. Every car should have their own gps and the drivers should speak in english. And it says that the rooms are soundproof but unfortunately it’s not, we always hear the moving of things in the upper room or in the side. And most of the time we heard “NO” immediaely from them which is a bad thing. We are their customer so before they could say no to us, they should asked first their manager if they could break the policy rules especially on terms of food. There is no any kind of privacy in the balcony, everyone who stays in the balcony can hear your conversation and see what you are doing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Peaceful hotel , clean and sober No food available after 11 pm"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Staff, location and room service food was fantastic."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Great location and very helpful staff Don’t serve alcohol in any form.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,"The breakfast was excellent.  The location in relation to shopping and the local mall was excellent. We booked this hotel on the strength of the ratings but unfortunately my experience was not that favourable.  I was expecting a modern 5 star hotel with service and quality to match but instead just got something average.  From our entrance I just found the welcome and the check in process a bit impersonal and cold.  I always find a good measure of quality is how well the uniforms fit the staff (not great).  The staff seemed to be inexperienced and not close to the level we experienced in other hotels in Sri lanka.  The rooms were clean on the whole but for some reason the walls in our rooms were solied, the decor was old fashioned and the hallway had a strange smell.   The changing area in the swimming pool and the steam room just felt like something that belonged to a public bath rather than a 5 star hotel. The conceirge was the worst I have ever experienced. I asked for a taxi and the the only thing he was willing to offer me was a hotel car (at a premium).  I then asked him how I would get back and was told to arrange my own transport.  I then asked hiim for a number of a local taxi company so I could arrange this to which his reponse was that he doesnt have any.  In contrast the experience in the Movempick, Taj and Shangri-la in Colombo was totally differrent."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Spacious room. 
The pool on the rooftop is amazing and the view fantastic. 
But the room don’t have good sonorisation. We heard our neighbor like they were in the room with us. Couldn’t sleep much.  There is a huge lack of communication at this hotel. 
We were in Colombo when there was the terrorist attacks and went out one hour after the blast not knowing what was going on. No one at the reception warn us. They just let us go outside without telling us it was dangerous. We went to the city center and came back 1 hour after we saw the terrible situation. "
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"Nothing. Never cleaned my room once. Dirty balcony. Horrible management, and more rude than anything I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. Do Not Stay Here. Horrible. Terrible location, and even worse staff. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Great pool and garden terrace It was in-between 2 building sites.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,Love the view and amenities The staff the second time we stayed seemed disinterested and fairly unhelpful at concierge and staff desks. 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"The rooftop pool, breakfast buffet. Lacking atmosphere."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,"Location and the room when we finally  checked in. The hotel staff were rude and unhelpful. We emailed the hotel on bookings.com a month before to let them know we wanted an early check-in, they replied saying they would do their best to accommodate us. This was a LIE!
After travelling for nearly 12 hours straight we arrived at the hotel, tired and desperate for some good sleep. When we tried to check-in early the staff at the desk said that we would have to wait until 7.30am bearing in mind we arrived at the hotel at 4.30am. They said that we could either pay for an extra night or wait. We tried to reason with them and showed the email we received however,  they still did not want to give us a room, eventhough one was a available. 
We then had to sleep in the lobby until my husband persuaded them to give us a room by 6.30am. 
Had we have known this would have been the case, we never would have stayed here!
Furthermore when we ordered food at the garden bar the following day, it took the staff over 25 minutes to let us know that the chosen food was not available. This to me in not 5 star service at all!  
The sunbeds by the pool were not enough for all the guests at the hotel so we were placed in a really awkward area away from the pool. We were not impressed at all! 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,Location We got bad rooms
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Gorgeous pool and great choice of restaurants. Ocean Grill and the Chinese restaurant were great - food and staff lovely in both. This hotel claims to be luxury but needs a lot of work and staff training to get there. Our stay was disappointing. Maintenance was an issue - bad finishes to rooms and bathrooms. Also, dirty mastic and grout. Bathrooms do not air out well. Staff are polite and try their best but, they’re not trained well enough for such a hotel. Orders are sometimes forgotten and staff are overworked. Management needs to do more!"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"Just the infiniti pool Area 
Very shady "
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,"Restaurant is too back.  Staff is not well trained. Not like a 5 star hotel.  I feel only 3 star hotel.

Ok I was lake it
"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Breakfast was awesome, different type of food.Swimming Pool was nice, feels like fresh water"
marino-beach-colombo, 3.3 ,"The pool was good.One Senior Guest Relations Executive tried to deliver the quality of service expected of the establishment. Tharuka was excellent in her role - quietly efficient and proactive. Unfortunately, the attitude and behaviour of junior staff at the Front Desk and Eating Places (obnoxious, insulting and down-right disrespectful)  made my continued stay untenable.  These employees ought not be in this industry where Courtesy to Guests is the cornerstone! I cancelled plans to extend my stay. It was just not worth the aggravation."
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,Credit card machine didn’t work 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Room was amazing modern style. full security close to  shopping mall .
Staff was really  outstanding.  We enjoy  lots. Specially  ghe garden  restaurant and rooftop bar  was amazing. We love  the  breakfast buffet and the staff  was very  helpful.  Main restaurant  manager  FAZIL was really  helpful.  Room  service  items was not  too much  after  12:00 at night.  And hotel  orientation.  I think  once  guest arrived to hotel from  front desk can do a hotel  orientation it will be more  perfect . "
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"The security head guy was so rude, he think all guest are suicide bomb attacker’s,talk very rude ,"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Infinity pool  Frigid staff 
marino-beach-colombo, 2.9 ,"Beautiful poolVery good shower Excellent concierge This is not a five star hotel it is a very tired 4 starIt’s old and in desperate need of an upgradeTired interiors, mould in the bathroom, stains on the carpetsAnd do not be misled by the “complimentary mini bar”- it’s a free Fanta and cokeThe balconies are revolting, unloved, simple and the glass filthy It also overlooks a train line which is very noisy The pictures and the write up is not an accurate description of this hotel Don’t waste your money, there are better places to stay."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Great location, great hotel The food at the restaurant left a little to be desired and could be much better"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"In general it looks good  The food wasn't good
Bed cover was dirty when they cleaned they just flip it out
I ordered some room dining and paid by card it was accepted and the waiter want to try again "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,They mixed booking and make us wait a lot until they found it.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Hospitality and cleanliness Restaurant 
marino-beach-colombo, 2.9 ,"I like very much the area, area securities and mall access Not allowing when my friends comes to drops me, to stay even a minute outside the area, to removes belongs. But I understand latest blasts need to concern."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,My room was big enough and sea facing. Hot water in the shower was not working and it took almost an hour for maintenance staff to fix it. Dinner in the restaurant was pathetic. Especially the italian dish I ordered was awful and doubt if the cream used was fresh. Checking out was disappointing. Had to wait for 20 minutes before some one could attend.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Rooftop pool area was great.  Communication with the property before arrival was non existent.  When we checked in they insisted we pay in advance.   We paid extra for s balcony room but were out on the lowest accommodation floor so our balcony was not elevated at all and was flush with a roof that had heat exchangers by our room.   Door to balcony didn’t open anyway so paying the extra was a waste of money.  We couldn’t charge food and drinks to our room unless we arranged special authorisation first so paid in cash.   When we checked out they said they were unable to call taxis so we’d need to stand by the road and find one ourselves.   Would not stay again because they made everything so difficult. 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Location and cleanliness  They charged me 4 nights 240 $ instead of 120$. 
Reached 10th June at 3am morning... they charged this till 12.05 PM  1 day. Also on 12th June I want to vacate 6pm they said it will be charged 1 day. As there checkout time is 12 PM.this is very bad. 
Also every day call come at 12.05 PM u want to checkout ..after paying 200 $ advance. This is ridiculous.. 
My experience  was very bad paying double the money.. after receive confirmation from them them they will allocate early check in . Very very bad. "
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,"Only the pool The food is  very  bad
Room service after 2am is also bad"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Staff are not experienced so did mistake even after reminder
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"It’s nicely located in front of the see and a nice view very modern and clean hotel and nice staff and the pool is perfect.  Very slow internet, the AC is very poor in rooms and public areas between rooms."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Hotel pool was great, rooms were clean and the service exceptional. It was quite far out of town - a few miles down the Galle Road. When the traffic bad it can take a while to get into Colombo central."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Rooms , location , comfort , pool. Rude staff , Poor english communication, had to park my own car with valet service available. denied me for breakfast even though i mentioned to pay at chkout while checking inn and staff denied me saying thats impossible. No prompt actions ."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Rooftop infinity pool is very good. Convenient local for seeing Colombo.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Requested a quiet room.Bedroom above a restaurant with the noise going on until 12.30am. Had to get up and go to reception . Next day had to chase management pertaining to a move as suggested the early hours in the am. It took waiting around for over 3.5 hours to move. No one aware of the noise concerns from the previous night.Had to inform staff that my room was not being made up until 15.00 hrs in the afternoon each day! Staff kept knocking on the door asking when I was going to checkout. I had just moved in!!!!!Room still noisy had to get out of bed again at 11.45 hrs the next night and bang on interconnecting doors as couple were loud & drunk.  Next new couple had the TV on loud until 1.25 hrs. So no sleep. No one contacted me to see if I was ok.Had to ask twice for laundry itinerary!!! No one offered drinks to me around the pool area.Glad to get home to have a quiet nights sleep! Rooms noisy. No drinks offered around the pool area.Room light did not work.Scales in bathroom not working.No spare toilet in toilet"
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,"Nothing good  The didn't provide welcome drinking for the second time
I called to change the bed cover and the did not change pillows cover and they were dirty
And he said I didn't bring the pillow cover
Bath shutter was not working so you don't have a privacy "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Brenda’s was very good!!But should have lunch . Not had lunch !!"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Rooftop infinity pool The hidden charges. I was suddenly charged double my stay for something no one could explain. All they said was we upgraded your rooms! I asked do you have a signature of our agreement ? They said no but we told you! This is what ruined my experience !!!!

marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Room facilities & food Room Service delay
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,front office staff very bad to talk with cousster
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The breakfast buffet was wonderful. There was certainly something for every taste and the food was well presented and delicious. High tea is highly recommended. I am a very light sleeper. We were on the 3rd floor and construction finished quite late at night and started early in the morning. I do realise that the hotel can do very little about that. Worse than the noise of construction was barking dogs in a house between us and the building site. Even with earplugs in, it was really difficult to sleep. Eventually they settled (they must have finally been taken indoors) only to start again at about 6 am. We were travelling with 3 other couples who were on higher floors and they didn’t hear anything but it did effect the quality of our 2 night stay. I did report this as we checked out and they have made a note to place us elsewhere, should we stay again. The only issues we had were difficult for the hotel to address. If you are a light sleeper, may I recommend that you ask for a room on the other side of the hotel and perhaps on a higher floor."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,The facilities were great and the staff was nice! Only thing is our Marino beach taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong place...even when we showed the address
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Pool on roof with ocean view Bad Sound proof between rooms, and between room and corridor"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"We had some issue in our room where there was a water leak from the ceiling .I guess it was from the air conditioner ,which we had to inform to the front desk and had a bit of a hard time to get a staff to come and look at it and resolve the issue. But the front office manager on duty that night Mr. Ramsheed Jainulabdeen was very helpful and he was very prompt in providing the best service and even changed our room with an upgrade as well. He personally came and made sure that  we were comfortable and that everything was alright. The front desk staffs were very slow and very poor customer service."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Courteous staff, good location. Nice terrace with pool. Request for late checkout was not even addressed despite requesting in advance on bookings.com . Ended up paying to extend the stay. Breakfast's bread selection had no vegetarian friendly pastries / savoury section except basic bun and wheat bread. Breakfast had almost everything on repeat for all 3-4 days we stayed, including main plates. Room service was extremely slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,The smell of cigarettes is all through the hallways. When the hotel is busy the service level is reduced. Do not use this hotel if you want to use the pool on your last day before going to the airport as you cannot use the facilities. Very poor wifi
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Friendly staff Bed sheet and pillow was a bit rough
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"I arrived at the hotel around 5pm, and the room wasn't ready, had to wait more than 30 minutes until they complete my check in, the Staff at front desk is awfully inefficient"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"
Location is very good specially the rooms facing the beach  Housekeeping and Front office is very slow in service "
marino-beach-colombo, 3.3 ,"The breakfast only The arrogant staff, bad room’s view, noisy internally and externally, lack of organization, bad smell in the rooms"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"It took us an hour to check in which was too tiring for us after a long hauled international flight.Even the room was not ready when we arrived, so we had to share our parents room for 2 hours!"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Location is close to shopping mall  Food,  check in and check out long process, rooms were not ready "
marino-beach-colombo, 3.3 ,"Good location but for white peoples only...  They have there own policy according to there choice as they think white / foreigners will pay them a a lot treat other Asians as beggars.
"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Beautiful pool, garden bar and breakfast. Very easy to get around via uber/taxi, and very helpful airport pick up late at night. I asked at the travel desk how to get to my next destination (Galle) and was given completely wrong instructions. Honestly I’m not sure why they had a travel desk, if they can’t tell you how to get to the closest city!"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,It has a Nice pool area at the top of the building.  Check in was very flow so be patient. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Location, in front of the sea, the rooftop is awesome, plus the connection with the mall also good."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Pool area The rooms are old and paint is worn off
Staff is not friendly 
Restaurant served us recooked food"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Bed is comfortable. The view of the swimming pool is amazing. The staff’s service if not warm at all.  The receptionist gave me a feeling that we were not welcome here. Waited few minutes after check in but can not find anyone to take our luggage to room. The tuktuk hotel called for us  kept taking us to some places we don’t wanna go which gave us a bad impression on Colombo.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"- The bed was very comfortable, once we were given one that was actually clean- The restaurant located at the adjoining tower was great, as was the bar with billiards tables- The pool and rooftop garden were nice however you are either looking at a construction sight or a dirty train line- Buffet breakfast had extensive choices but I felt sick after eating and we found the food quite bland - First impression was bad, staff on counter checking us in was very rude and not helpful at all- When we got to the room we couldn't use it, it was not clean from the last people who stayed there... hair all over the messily made bed, hand and fingerprints prints all over the glass throughout the room, coffee marks on bench tops, floor was wet with dirty marks all over it. It took an hour and a half to be allocated a new room. - Management were quite arrogant to deal with. No apologies or compensation offered.- Our 'partial sea view room' had no view of the sea at all - Hotel is only 1 year old however things are already fallen off and damaged in the room and at the pool, would not recommend bringing kids- Have to call to find out where meals are served, opening times if facilities as nothing is explained by staff... Staff all seem to be quite young and interested in their own conversations rather than work- Complementary mini bar only holds 3 soft drinks and a juice box... I would prefer a full and extensive mini bar that I can purchase from for convenience - Door staff were great on our way in and helped us get bags out of the car however on check out they did not lift a finger or even acknowledge us"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Swimming pool, breskfast Launder service very slow. Rates hiked outrageously. No sense of customer loyalty - we asked to stay an extra night at the same rate but were given 2 times the previous rate. Booked the same hotel and same room online and got the same previous rate."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Rooms The management have very bad customer service skills. They are stern, dont smile and gave a negative attitude which started from checkin and continued. Particularly the senior management who are rude and arrogant; this attitude filters down through to all the staff. For a country full of smiles theres a distinct lack of them in marino. We had many run-ins with the management who wont budge on anything. Its a shame because the hotel has potential."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Buffet Breakfast was Awesome!!
marino-beach-colombo, 4.2 ,It was not comfortable at all for a family The unfriendly staff and the comfortableness
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"- Location was good- Airport transportation provided by the hotel was cheap and good. 1- front desk gave us wrong info, he said breakfast included, but it was not.2- more elevators needed, we had to wait long for our turn.3- rooms not sound proof, you can hear  neighbors very clearly.4- laundry took 2 days to get done.5- you need to deposit insurance money if you want things to be charged on the room, otherwise you pay cash or credit to get the service , due to this inconvenience our change for cash payment arrived 2 hours late.6- super slow service, every time we need a service done we have to call more than 3 times, then we have to call the manager to get it done.7- (GOT FOOD POISONING EATING THE SPINACH RAVIOLI) , vomiting and diarrhea after i ate it."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,Location  Not friendly  staff at reception 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Bed was quite comfortable, hotel comes along with a mall attached to it and many good restaurants. Staff was friendly  Had to wait 20 minutes standing just to check in because there weren’t enough people at the desk. Pool was so dirty we couldn’t spot the bottom and there were plastic bottles swimming in it also, our room looked clean but it was cleaned very superficial like the sink itself was clean but you could see the marble around the sink hasn’t been cleaned in a long time, there were pieces of cutten nails on it even... the bathtub I would never use cause it wasn’t cleaned properly. We had hairs on our pillow sheets but figured/hoped they might have gotten there from the staffs head or whatsoever, still not the nicest thing to see. Also we both got 1 room keycard that’s attached to all the electricity inside the room and you also need the card to use the lift so it’s impossible for one person to go outside the room while the other stays inside the room - either one person can’t use the lift to get anywhere or the other ends up without electricity in the room cause the card is missing. So for that amount of money (about 115€ a night, which is a lot in SL) it just wasn’t worth it at all. Had so many better hotels for the same amount of money in SL. Glad we only stayed two nights... "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,Location and the Infinity pool were superb My stay was really a dissapointed one because I requested and paid for an extra bed on my checkin 1.00 pm and I was not provided the extra bed even after making several calls. They kept telling me that I haven’t paid for an extra bed and after checking several times they informed me that it is on the way. I was waiting untill 10pm and went to sleep sharing three individuals the same bed for two people. In the mid night at extactly 12.00am there was a staff member ringing the door bell with an extra bed. Ruined my stay. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"I like the rooftop pool and affordable room service. The shade in my bathroom was broken, I didn’t always get more conditioner for my hair. Most staff I interacted with were lovely, but I didn’t enjoy the workers behind the desk at check in/out. When I had an issue with they room they did little to help resolve it and were very hands off. The lady at the reception desk was nice though."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"Good location, good facilities. Nice rooftop pool. Really good dinner buffet in the restaurant. For a relatively new hotel, it already feels a bit dated. The room had a bit of a smell, maybe paint or moisture I'm not sure but nothing too serious."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,"Clean and location in the room we could listen to everything from the hall.They took to long to bring our luggage to the room, and any person can go from the shopping mall to the hotel without supervision.We traveled within all Sri Lanka, this hotel was the only place that we didn’t feel safe.."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"The service was good The transport to and from the hotel was a big issue.I felt perhaps wrongly that the bell boys and porters were part on the act with the taxi drivers to overcharge guests who have to travel to the airportWhat out for fraudulent tuk tuk drivers and so called gem shops -we did not fall for it as we read on trip advisor how they can cheap tourists."
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,We saw one cockroach in our room.

marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The pool was lovely. Provided us breakfast even though time was up.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,I will visit again as well as I am recommending thisp Marino hotel  to everyone . I am sure everyone will enjoy😊 . Not been cleaned properly then I informed the domestic and been cleaned again .
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"The infinity pool is great,  the room was nice and spacious as is the bathroom. Good location, not great.  Our room had an adjoining door and it was very loud in the next room, you can hear everything. The staff took a very time to bring any requested items to the room.  The tea place in the lobby overcharged us and then argued that their system had different prices to the menu so it was just bad luck. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The location was good
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,"Fresh. New. Clean. The Reception staff is very rude and unprofessional.
No cooperation and courtesy for any matter."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"It was average. Nothing to brag about.  Rooms were comfortable. Lot of services available in the complex. Roof top pool was nice although the beverage service was sub par. Breakfast buffet should have had more Sri Lankan options. I don't go to Sri Lanka to eat Indian, Japanese or Western food.Customer service was sub par. Requested late check out till 3.00 PM. I was told they are sold out and can only extend till 1.00PM. However, I later found out that the room was not cleaned by house keeping even at 3.00 PM when I went to pick up an item that we left behind. They could have easily accommodated our late check out request."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Actually they have a wonderful hotel with an amazing location on the ocean but unfortunately the staff are not helpful, they didn't try to help me by giving me a room with a separate beds, i tried to tell them its my 1st wedding anniversary and I'm here to enjoy it in there property but they didn't even tried to help that makes me next day to upgrade it.
But let's say that i enjoyed because the hotel is good that's it."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,Pool and staff Food and service (asked for payment all the time instead of letting us pay all at the end)
marino-beach-colombo, 4.0 ,I was suppose to get ocean facing room but they did not provide it They did give me partial sea face room
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The pool The parking system. You have no excess to the rooms from the car park
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"liked the ambience..liked the politeness of the staff and dining place and buffet stewards , chefs , liked the travel desk and the security staff at the entrance liked the buffet breakfast and  lunch spread.liked the chinese restuarant. the toilets and bathroom inside the room ....my room no . was 441 ... were smelly.the ventilation and exhaust system is inadequate and not keeping the bathing area and bathroom fresh.no bathroom fresher like ctronella or lemon grass usually used in five star hotels  was found in the bathrooms or used when cleaning... to leave a fresh fragrance.THE TOILETERIES ... ESPECIALLY THE SHAVING KIT WAS A DISASTER   ... VERY CHEAP AND ABRASIVE ... NOT EVEN CAN BE USED FOR A SINGLE USE  WITHOUT CUTING YOUR FACE.THE TOOTHPASTE AND BRUSH WERE EQUALLY LOW QUALITY ..PERSONALLY CALLED THE FRONT OFFICE ASSISTANT MANAGER MR. RAMSHEED... HE CLAIMED TO BE THE HIGHEST GUY ION THE HOTEL HIERACHY AFTER THE CEO OR OWNERS.... ASKED HIM TO PICK UP FIVE SHAVING KIT FROM THE HOUSEKEEPING ON 4TH FLOOR AND TRY THEM HIMSELF TO GET REAL LIFE FEEL OF THE INFERIOR SHAVER AND SHAVING CREAM.AFTER LISTENING TO MY STORY HE ADVISED ME TOP EMAIL THE MANAGEMENT"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Nice rooms, spacious. Great bathroom Rooms are cold, and not only with temperature.. I didn’t like floors which are tiled. I stayed 3 nights and couldn’t step out to the balcony as it was flooded with water and never cleaned. It was second time in this hotel and my room didn’t have view. Windows to be cleaned more often. There is no noise protection, I could hear other guests talking (I was sharing interconnecting room). Bedding wasn’t good, I was cold under the thin blanket, no duvet."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Location Poor for sea foods
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Good breakfast..Did not expect 6 lane traffic and double track railway between beach and hotel, with trains honking noisy horns from 5 am. see above"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Staff very pushy  Decore is dated 
marino-beach-colombo, 6.0 ,Gym and Pool Rude staff
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"excellent shower, terrific breakfast selection (sadly cold dishes which were meant to be hot) staff treating guests with suspicionpoor customer service - staff unable to answer basic questionspervy male staff standing around the pool area, none doing any work, spitting in gardenno pool bar service offered, confronted to confirm if we had paid before leaving pool areamajor construction next door, eliminated any opportunity for relaxation by the great pooltrains running and honking horns directly outside - no privacy or security on balconyhard mattress and room needs a deep clean"
marino-beach-colombo, 4.0 ,"Breakfast was good, gym and pool facilities are excellent. The hotel advertised a taxi service at a fixed price of $17 USD.  We had confirmed that our luggage would fit and paid for the taxi in full the night before departure as we were leaving early the next morning.  After checking out, we were informed that our bags would not fit and we would have to pay an extra $35USD for the cab service.  In the end we order an Uber, which came to $14USD and fortunately made it on time for check-in at the airport.  This was a disappointing end to our trip to beautiful Sri Lanka."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Excellent gym with loads of equipment and infinity pool is pretty spectacular Stale feel to the place and the spot it sits in Colombo has very little around it to do.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Enjoyed staying in the room. Good location and good breakfast Left a watch in a bathroom was taking shower before check out . Came back after few days and been told it wasn’t there. Unbelievable that they having stuff who stealing from the clients. Even wasn’t interested to help find this watch which cost me 300$
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,The pool and gym The air conditioning didn’t cool below 22 in the room and 24 in the gym
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,"Not much  We left some duty free things in the room. Realised when we got to Negombo. Called reception and were advised they would charge us 9000 to deliver it. An uber cost 1500 one way so 3000 - 5000 would be reasonable not 9000. 
Had to leave it there. Hope someone enjoys it. Pretty crappy service and attitude. Won't be back. "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.0 ,"Good breakfast Good locationGood facilities Staff at security checkpoint very aggressiveStaff at taxi counter needed repeated reminding of our booking - we nearly missed the flight because they lost bookingCheck in took 30 minutes at 230pm. That’s a decent time and I already sent 2 emails stating that but still not ready. So overall, staff efficiency and high price is the weakest point of hotel"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"I stayed here 2 night, i didn’t have wow experience, but is was ok. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"I email them and ask to do spme special arrangements as I was coming for the 2nd year annviesary.They promised me a cake through email.When I was checking in I asked the reception is it arranged they said yes,I want it to be a suprise.But unfortunately there was no any kind of arrangement in the room.
Room ,Pool and food was great.
"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Very good facilities  and location 
It was clean and comfortable  Nothing "
marino-beach-colombo, 2.9 ,"Maybe breakfast, but it’s overpriced. Lots of places offers you the same for the less price  First of all, the check in took almost 40 minutes. 5 star service? No. Also, the woman at reception asked to pay forward for all stay and tried to warn about additional fees if I’ll pay by card, but every time I asked to clarify I got answer “sorry, no speak English”. I repeat, this is 5 star hotel. 
The interior everywhere is quite old, but mostly clean. But the rooms is just nightmare. You could see the photos. wallpaper was covered from floor to ceiling with different colors streaks, they were peeling off everywhere. All surfaces are scuffed, even the painting has dirty fingerprints. Shower and bathroom is ok, but all you got for your stay is a couple of 50ml bottles of shampoo etc. 
One more interesting thing-no one warns you about huge construction near the hotel, the building already has 6 more floors than Marino beach. And of course, it’s very noisy, so you can’t chill at the pool, you can’t open a window and the view from my balcony (I booked sea view)-well, it’s sea view, but with construction. 
At last, when I checked out (surprisingly fast) I asked to leave my luggage for three days because of my trip to sigiriya, Kandy, etc. and what do you think? I got refused and asked to book another room! I had to do that to be able to leave my luggage and that’s a big luck they giddy try to charge me, when I came back. 
Overall it’s not worth it. Try another one, maybe it would be a place without a pool, but come on, you’re on the island in Indian Ocean, you don’t need the pool that much. "
marino-beach-colombo, 6.0 ,Next to construction site
marino-beach-colombo, 6.2 ,Fancy Major construction by the pool and railway keeps you up during the night. Service at the pool and restauarants is unbearably slow
marino-beach-colombo, 5.4 ,"The pool and the cleanness  Everything else was horrible! The service, the way we were treated, the room service food was bad! "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Best pool ever. Construction going on next door.Smoking allowed. Bad smell on floor."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"Infinity pool & breakfast (Nadeesha was awesome). Rest I rather not comment. Poor language communication and comprehension of the staff; inconvenience of not transferring expenses incurred in the pre-authorized amount. Advertisement of booking.com 9.1 rating on every floor cannot hide the in-competencies and in-effectiveness of the staff. 15 rings on the reception line going unanswered, no show from bell boy during check-out, unavailability of hotel airport transfer are serious issues. Marino Beach Hotel needs to improve on these elements to push up Sri Lankan tourism. I don't want to sound extremely harsh but kindly take a tour of any tier 2 level Indian city beyond Chennai and assess what I mean by customer service."
marino-beach-colombo, 4.6 ,"Food in buffet. Balcony small, no table. No mini bar. Can not change air con temperature. Overpriced. Not 5 star hotel - max 4 star. Taxi service double - from street can get 50% less. Uber block on hotel territory. Tv quality very bad. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Excellent charm and location. Very clean and well maintained iconic hotel. The pool area and natural garden are amazingly well maintained and offer mesmerizing ocean and city view. However, the dinner buffet was disappointing in terms of selection, taste and pricing. We were really looking forward to more Sri Lankan dishes which were unfortunately and surprisingly missing from the spread (except for Curry and rice). The cocktails at the bar could also be much better and same goes for the breakfast spread in terms of selection and overall taste. 
Staff is very friendly and polite. Great hospitality. "
marino-beach-colombo, 2.0 ,Nothing  Very bad experience the worst customer service 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Pool was lovely. buffet breakfast was impressive. Train line in front of property.
Check-in was extremely slow and no flexibility on an early Check-in we’ve with advanced notice.
As we had early checkout we were informed that a take away breakfast could supplied, we heard no more from the hotel.
"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.0 ,The pool the handicap bathroom
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,"Room, food, gym and pool and other facilities are excellent  The balcony not cleaned daily. Lot of dust from outside and neighboring building & works. Also lots of dust under the bed which is not cleaned regularly. Proper cleaning must be a MUST"
marino-beach-colombo, 6.7 ,"It was clean and conveniently located.  We Checked Into our room and their was luggage and coats on the bed and five bags that were not ours. It took the staff a long time to sort this out and they offered no apology which didn’t make me feel very secure about our luggage. 
Out key card stopped working twice and we had to get reception to fix it twice, again no apology. 
The staff here need some serious customer relations training to meet the level of a five star hotel. 
Construction of a larger hotel next door means the pool are is not very relaxing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 2.0 ,"Rooms and bathrooms and all hotel are good but the service and the people who are working on it they are so bad from the reception to room service even the restaurant all are same.. Just shouting.  The hotel is good but the stuff very rude really i am so sorry to see and deal with such kind of people they will makes the hotel lose of their way of customers service dealing. I never been to any hotels in the world with this way.
Even the cleaning of the room is bad. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Door to balcony to get some real air was good.  The pool looked good but we didn’t use it. Nice and clean.  Great to have 4am wake up call and espresso to the room for early flight.  A 5 min tuk tuk to fort area.  
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Good location, excellent pool Can be cleaner"
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"Poor Taxi service For payment the reception keep calling even after informing that it will be done by evening as I am out.Room service is not good."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,Check-in was smooth. The breakfast spread buffet was good and had a reasonable amount of variety and selections. Rooms were comfortable with modern amenities. Rooms could use a little more vacuuming. Some dust in the rooms perhaps city dust rom the air-vent systems. Some information provided by staff were sometimes confusing. The hotel taxi counter was terrible.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Breakfast & Dinner Quality should be Upgraded. Coffee is NO good. Ive avoided. Foods were not well cooked. Monotonous items, should have been changed with variations. F & B Director should have been put attention & attendance during Breakfast time. Mentioned"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,The pool was the best thing - although the building works all around were noisy The noise from construction around
marino-beach-colombo, 5.8 ,Hotel is over rated and not with the money value. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Excellent service and very friendly staff! Breakfast choices are overwhelming, do not skip breakfast here!! Bar&restaurant requires direct payment if you do not pay more in advance.
  Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Cleanliness Room service (worst policy of paying money every time if u order any food items)
marino-beach-colombo, 6.0 ,"Clean Was not informed of the building work. Sitting by the pool was very noisy.I asked for a quiet room. I believe I was allocated one, but the room next door was very noisy into the early hours. The hotel did deal with it, but I could still hear other 'parties' in the hall and in other rooms.When looking to book a car for the afternoon, the concierge quoted me double what other providers paid."

Rate The rooms arounds are very noisy"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.5 ,Loved the swimming pool Could have had a nice rooftop bar..
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,Buffet breakfast we very good. Waiting staff were a little to anxious to clear finished plates and did not wait until both my wife and I had finished before whipping away my plates whilst my wife was still eating. Waiting process seemed very mechanical  (getting job done as quickly as possible) and not geared to customer service or comfort. We stayed twice over a three week period. First room was excellent in every way. Second room was dirty (bed headboard grooves) and was in need of decorating.(Wall finishings were coming away). For this standard of hotel and cost this was unacceptable. Checking in second time was poor and seemed like a chore for staff member as did delayed check out process.
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,The toilet was overflowing
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,breakfast is not so good as expected for the hotel like this.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,I left a watch in my previous hotel..but thank God.I met a staff member Sumith he was incredible and done a fabulous job and went out of the way to organise a courier who went to the previous place picked up the parcel and return it on time...thank you for the service..he deserve a raise I wish they jad more vegetarian food options 
marino-beach-colombo, 1.0 ,overall the service was extremely poor..and the duty manager ramsheed is very mean no social skills at all ..didn allowe any of my guest to visit ..and made my stay waste of money ..
marino-beach-colombo, 6.0 ,"Room service is severely bad at night. Waited from 21.45 until 12.15am for delivery, after numerous calls. Eventually the manager showed up with a sandwich, only to cough his heart out without covering his mouth. While the rest of the world is in Corona quarantine. Horrible!  I am never going back!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,Clean and comfortable. Spacious. Friendly and polite staff. View from balcony. Noise in corridor at night from guests. Reception staff gave incorrect info ie  can’t pay in local currency. Room dining service....sandwich was very salty and wrong price on receipt
marino-beach-colombo, 7.1 ,"Good base to touch down in Colombo. Clean and tidy. Location let it down a little, and there are significant building works very close by which make rooftop pool far from relaxing."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Its not a beach/ sea view property, its rooftop pool has a view of the sea, its a road side hotel Location"
marino-beach-colombo, 2.5 ,"Please be careful with this hotel! Our money has been stolen inside our room. After check-in we left our bags in our room to go for swimming a couple of times. The next morning we ordered a transfer to Galle, everything fine until we arrived at our next stop and had to pay for our driver. We discovered that our money was missing. It’s very sad as we really trusted the hotel with our money. We have been to a lot of 5 star hotels and this is the first time we get bribed like this. Please understand you ruin other people’s vacation and you have no idea the damage you have done!!
I have send a mail to the hotel, providing the room number and other necessary information. As I stated in the mail, no reply back is me publishing this on Booking to warn other people about their stay.
It is really sad, I always like to write a positive review about our stay. But the fact that we got bribed weights out all the other positive things in the hotel.
I will update my feedback if something changes about this situation."
marino-beach-colombo, 5.0 ,"Breakfast spread was great, but there was no staff attending the needs of a customer Must have few staff near the stalls"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.0 ,"Room was very comfortable and the poolWas great. The staff around the pool seem lazy. Wet towels left on chairs and on the floor so you didn’t know if chairs were vacant or not. Some towels stayed out allDay."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Wow! We have been to Colombo many times. But this stay at Marino Beach made it unforgettable. The rooftop infinity swimming pool & the deck made our day. Truly amazing...best in Colombo.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"This was an AMAZING place to stay. I could not recommend it enough! The staff were super friendly and helpful. It was a great pit stop after a long flight. The city of Colombo leaves little to be desired however this hotel was fantastic! I am backpacking and they were very helpful giving tips for the best approach to our journey. They also let me check is well before my check in time which was much appreciated after the long flight! Beautifully decorated, Lovely poolAnd very clean and comfortable room! Would 100% recommend if staying in Colombo!!! Value for money was great- was worth twice the price!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,The pool was great. Although there should be a poolside bar and pool heating should be available when the pool is too cold to get in. Rooms were clean and nice. The room service food was value for money. Reasonable.  It took us over 30 minutes to check in. They dint have proper WiFi in the rooms. The the TV channels are so slow and it disconnects automatically. Check out was even worse. We had to call them 5 times to come collect the baggage’s. Waited over 40 minutes for someone to come collect the bags to check out. And then had to wait another 20 minutes to check out. The buffet lacks variety and options. We hardly had a selection of food items to choose from.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent choice to stay in Colombo. New property with extremely clean surroundings. Esp infinity pool on the roof top is a marvellous facility with this location Check-in experience : they should allow early check-in for customers atleast on a courtesy basis. Food: should improve the food which is being ordered through room service. Should’ve chefs from the relevant countries to match the tastes as everything is made of srilankan taste. jus my opinion to give a genuine feedback to the hotel management to improve on these things. I liked this property and would definitely stay here every time we visit Colombo."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great service. Good food, nice facilities Noise from the linked room."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel should be rated five star as we checked out of Cinnamon lake side and checked to Marino. Big difference and the rates are ideal. Please maintain as it is. The lobby looked empty and the longe is too dark. Lobby should have more activities like live band, or some sort of activity for guest to sit and enjoy. Lots of space let for bit more furniture and wall decor The swimming pool and the rooms"

The facilities are superb. The pool alone is worth the stay. Many of the staff (concierge, travel desk, check in personal and wait staff) have little hotel experience. When I first checked in, I did not understand this and was really irked by the petty behavior of staff working in a luxury hotel. (They held my laundry hostage until I came down to pay for it at the reception! Instead of putting my meal on my room, an officious manager literally marched me up to my room and back and forced me to bring my credit card to the restaurant. They acted as if I was a bum off the street rather than someone paying for and staying at a luxury hotel. I was pissed, insulted and humiliated and told them as much.) It was only later that I learned that the manger's prior experience was a flight attendant on Qatar Air. So, this stuff is NOT acceptable and I hope they learn that. Also, they will need to reconsider their menu as they continue. The breakfast buffet was fine. But I avoid buffets as a seasoned traveler in the region because they are petri dishes and often make me ill. There were no tantalizing al a cart options.
The hotel also MUST learn to go green. They should give guests option to forgo daily linen changes and towel changes. The hotel needs to cut down on its plastic consumption. Instead of providing guests with small water bottles at the gym, why not do what others do and put in a water cooler? Similarly, the hotel's laundry service loves plastic.  Most luxury hotels in South Asia have done away with this: your either put your clothes in a paper or reusable cloth bag and your clothes are returned in a basket or paper...NOT plastic. This too will ultimately save the hotel. Such a move will help take pressure off the environment AND save the hotel money and will help preserve the island's precious water resources while reducing the amount of plastic dumped into the sea. The inability/unwillingness to let you put charges on your room without being treated like an absconder.The hotel's nonadoption of green policies (water cooler in the gym instead of small, plastic water bottles; the overuse of plastic in the laundry service; the lack of ""green options"" with respect to NOT changing the linens.The bedbugs in Room 406. It created a huge problem with laundry contamination and left me covered in bites that continue to harass me nearly 5 days later. Note that this is a new hotel. A guest likely brought them in. My previous room on the 3rd floor had no such problem. The mini bar had nothing terribly interesting in it. They could step up the minibar game. But this requires them to treat guests likely guests of a luxury hotel instead of potential absconders. I wonder if they get a lot of backpackers who like to stay in a nice hotel on their way home? That could explain some of the assumptions and the bed bugs? I don't know..."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Room, location, view and pool. Staff were unacceptable. Most do not speak good English. They had forgotten to book the hotel car that would take us to the airport. Οf course they did not admit it! The driver of the hotel car, who took us to the airport, did not want to use the motorway because it includes tolls. We explained that we had already prepaid the toll route. He contacted the hotel and brought us but reluctantly.The breakfast was good and rich, but the restaurant was below average. Frozen food, small portions and immobile."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Clean, nice staff especially the guy who called Asiry and the mall beside the hotel. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"A brand new hotel as of end July 18. Amazing pool. Great breakfast. Large rooms next to the sea. Friendly staff.  Front desk was so slow every time. The main disappointment. And location was a bit from the main centre, maybe a 5-10 min Tuk tuk ride from Galle Face beach. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It's a new, clean, comfort and very nice hotel. Sky pool is beyond the expectation. It's under construction."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"New hotel, big rooms, sea view, roof garden, infinity pool, restaurant. Food emporium in shopping mall.Very good chefs - limited menu, but very high quality food, well presented.Hotel located in same building as shopping mall, with adult electronic ""play area"" - motor-cycles with virtual reality headsets. Nothing at all, but my boss had commented concerning limited vegetarian choices for dinner menu."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Brand new hotel. Everything was great. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, excellent selection of Sri Lankan food as well as good Western options. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"I loved my room, the bed and the view. The roof top is wonderful and the view is superb. You can feel that the hotel is brand new and that the staff is under training still. I guess in a few months the service level will be better however this is not a bad thing as all team members are super nice and helpful. Can recommend this property to other travelers."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Its a huge hotel with well trained staff and excellent rooms. They have to increase North Indian food items in their menu...

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Infinity pool with view of the ocean was divine!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Spacious rooms ! Love the infinity pool and good food as well
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The infonity pool for sure and the brealfast Nothing comes in mind
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Stayed here 2 times already and can only recommend this property! Staff needs a bit more training on how to deal with customers especially at the pool. There is no service at all, they keep standing there. Also it would be necessary to inform guests that there are 2 hot water pools which are amazing after you come out of the long infinity pool."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Quite and most welcoming staff. Didn’t expect this much of hospitality from them but amazing experience. Infinity pool is quite amazing must try. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,every thing  is very  goood nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Check in was very slow
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Infinity pool. Balcony with ocean view. Breakfast in bed. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything about it, the quietness, the view, the comfortability, the food, the entire service "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Room service is very good. Wonderful room with nice fittings. Very clean the facilities and junior staffs are very very good. They are friendly too. Looks the senior staffs and front desk staffs are not enough professional. But again Junior staffs are very good.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Stunning views from the infinity pool
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The hotel is beautiful ,especially the view of the beach! Would love to explore this hotel a little more on our next trip. Thank you! The food was a little dry and the staff could have been a little more attentive at breakfast..otherwise its a great hotel!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,😍
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Fabulous infinity poolGreat breakfastGreat view from the roofThe bathrooms were modern and clean The location is a little bit out of the centre."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Clean rooms good service good staff When I checked in they gave a room with two separated beds and he told me by morning they will change it to one king size bed in the morning I called the reception asking them about changing the room I found that he got no clue and told he will call again but he didn't and I called after it two times same answer that they will call again but they didn't so I had to go down to the reception to finish this 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Everything was good . I wish the caution deposit they (reception) initially take from us should be returned back in same currency during check out. Currency exchange rate policy
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and the overall stay experience was great. The breakfast spread was very good and good choice for vegetarians too. Clean and Smells fresh! - We have bad experience in the restaurant during dinner on 30th August 2018. We have ordered a vegetarian biriyani, but we found some chicken pieces in it. Being vegetarians by religion and never tasted it, it was really a worst experience for us during this trip. We have clearly informed to the person who booked our order to ensure no mushrooms, no eggs, no chicken, no mutton and no sea foods in it. He has understood clearly and ended up with this situation. Please train your chef and other people in the restaurant to give value for the guest's requirements and expectations.- AC in the rooms should be improved.- The check-in process should be improved as it consumes too much of time."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Reception,staffs , services ,and good location . Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Great service on arrival, the room and the gym were excellent We ordered room service, we were told it was chicken breast, when it came it wasn't. When we said we didn't want it they said they couldn't refund us but would swap it for something else however we didn't have the time to wait. We also ordered a cheee cake room service. Because we were leaving at 3.30am we offered to pay then which they insisted. We didn't have the right change so asked them to tuck the money under the door. In the morning when we were rushing to check out the money had not been returned to us so we had to go to the front desk and get this. However the restaurant had not informed or given the money to reception. This took up valuable time of ours which we didn't have."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Extra-ordinary infinity pool! Enjoyed every single moment all day long. Breakfast is good with wide variety. Staff is very friendly and cooperative. location is amazing with close proximity to down town, city markets and major restaurants. I was in August 2018 in which hotel was still going thru construction and minor touches were put that caused some disturbance."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Nice rooms, building going on outside currently and hotel had just opened so no pool bar as advertised. Location on seafront but not a beach and have to cross train track to get to seafront. Nice restaurant but maybe a little expensive. Staff friendly and helpful and children loved the pool. Restaurant a little expensive. Seafront but not beach - rocky and sea always in plus train track immediately in front of rock barrier to sea"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I like the rooftop pool overlooking the ocean.  Although the construction prevented me from enjoying the pool and other facilities, the staff tried their best to accommodate my requests.  The food was excellent. kept me waiting for 2 hours to check-in to the hotel. once checked in, it was not the room I had requested, and also the construction disturbed me. It was too loud and I had to request another room.  I end up giving up my superior king to a twin bedroom to avoid the noise.  However, the staff, was very nice and tried to help."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great location, excellent service, beautiful food and wonderful room."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"All of the staff were welcoming, friendly, polite, professional and helpful, and all made my stay thoroughly enjoyable. 
Everything was so clean, the room was perfection, the bed comfortable, the pool amazing, and the food impeccable. I really cannot fault this hotel. The staff are a credit to themselves and the hotel.  I didn't like that I had to leave. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Very clean and spacious room. Excellent breakfast with lots of choice. Great facilities.  Couldn't really use the balcony as was next to the fans for the air-conditioning. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Ambiance, view, spaciousness, cleanliness, comfort. Nothing to complain!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Hotel facilities, staff, cleaness everything was perfect..."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It is against my self interest to give my opinion of this hotel. THE MARINO BEACH IS AMAZING!!The facilities are second to non. Pool,gym,restaurant,food and staff are the best I have seen in a long time. Bill Australia"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Pool and rooftop garden.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Awesome Pool, friendly staff, very good Restaurant, great Gym 👍👍👍"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Pool, gym, friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms  Far from city center/airport"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Stay here for the new rooms, the fabulous ocean views, the infinity pool and an excellent gym. Perfect for a family or a business traveler Decor will not age well. The lobby is awfully empty. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"THE PROPERTY IS VERY NEW, THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME QUALITY OF SERVICE AND CLEANLINESS.1) STAFF ARE FRIENDLY, RECEPTION STAFF  LITTLE  SLOW, ONLY ONE GIRL FROM PHILLIPS SHE IS GOOD. OVER ALL THE PROPERTY IS EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY AND THE BREAKFAST VARIETY IS TOO GOOD. I SUGGESTED TO FIX A TOWEL HANGER , NOTHING MUCH  TO COMPLAIN ."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff were very helpful and friendly, the location is great, the rooftop pool has a great view and the food is fantastic - great place. I have no complaints."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The hotel was superb. Beautifully decorarted rooms. Enjoyed the stay. Food was yummy.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"This hotel is beautiful. The rooms, pool, views are just top notch. The staff are also lovely and were very accomodating. We stayed in the corner panoramic view room and it was just amazing watching the sun set  My only criticism would be that the sun lounger are missing the cushions and are pretty hard without them  "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Everything is ok but.... Neighbor building is under construction, I can't get slep on night as there are too much noise."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Brand new hotel (open end July 2018), very comfortable.
Apparently it seems possible to have joint rooms for family. But hotel staff was not aware of it.
Very nice swimming pool on the room. Infinity pool with sea view.
Not too far from national museum and fort. We hired a van from the hotel to visit these places and then go to the airport. Not cheap but a brand new Mercedes van and a very nice driver. Longest check in I ever had. We arrived at night, after 8. There was just one person at front desk. He told us to sit down and wait. I can back before being called. Everything was complex. My family had to wait 1 hour before getting into the room.
This is a new hotel built by a furniture shop tycoon, with no experience in hotels and apparently no external professional firm for help. They need to learn how to manage hotels."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Hole the hotell Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything was nice great!  The toilet accessories like shampoo, conditioner, body was & soap can be of better quality "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Everything, good value for money  Nothing in particular . All was good for a business travel."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Room cleanliness and rooftop. Overall everything. Great customer care.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Fantastic property  Classic location 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Access to mall directly Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This hotel was amazingThe pool is waouhhhhThe staff is veryyyyyy nice The rooms are amazingthe food is very goooood maybe the view from our room was not the best as they are a lot of constructions going on in this area but its not their fault!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Room was furnished really good and the Roof top pool was just amazing.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,One amazing property in Colombo 👌🏽 Nothing that I didn’t like
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was fabulous.  Nothing..everything was incredible. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Location, staff, buffet spread, view I had opted for an ocean view room & at the time of checkin I was told that Delux rooms have partial sea views & not full sea view..I need to upgrade to a signature room & pay $50 extra. I had already paid for a sea view room then why this extra amount now? I refused & checked in my delux room & from the balcony I could see huge water tanks on terraces of adjacent buildings & clothes drying...I should have just taken a regular room & not paid a premium for a sea view room for this view...however the staff was kind enough to give us a late check out..."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"amazing infinity pool, very clean"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It's an excellent hotel very clean
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything ! 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The infinity pool on the roof was the highlight of my entire Sri Lanka trip. The room service food was delicious and very reasonably priced. The airport shuttle is also very reasonably priced. The room facilities are everything you would expect from such a hotel. The staff was really helpful and friendly. The room have a huge TV screen, and many entertainment options. I had some problems with the payments and credit card lock, but after a couple of emails to the hotel, it was very quickly resolved as well."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,It is a nice hotel. The facilities are good. The staff is pleasant. The room we had was spacious and clean We did feel that the hotel as a whole tries a bit too hard and fail on little things that could be sorted in no time. Just as an example the coffee was offered by floor walkers when it would be better to have a nice cafetière on the table. The carpets in the hallway to the rooms were stained. We did not get our luggages delivered to the room in 2 hours and ended up going down to get them ourselves. Sometimes it is better to do small things perfectly rather than too many things averagely
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The rooftop pool was really cool to watch the sunset, right on the water.  Friendly staff.  Brand new hotel. Location a bit isolated right now, will be built up more.  The bar and food closed a bit early, would have liked it open until at least 11:00pm."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The view, the rooftop, the swimming pool Basin was tripping on the floor, the hotel smell is very penetrant"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Facilities in the room were excellent Check in room long time.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff were lovely! Catered to our every need. Opened doors for us, helped us get to our next location and even sung me happy birthday to me with a little cake and candle. The pool is phenomenal. Overlooks the sea and the sun sets there were delightful in September!  Needs more shade at the pool and would love an easier way to order drinks there too. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The hotel was super clean. The infinity pool is breathtaking.  Certainly worth the money. I had to call 3 times for the towels and nobody came. I had to go out and get it from the housekeeper myself. Room service is not the greatest.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel has very attentive and friendly staff. The rooms themselves are clean, spacious and have all necessary amenities. Absolute highlights are a) the enormous rooftop pool and b) the extensive breakfast buffet. All in all a great place to stay when in CMB! Nothing at all. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I stayed over at Marina Beach during the day to get dressed for my wedding which was to be held  close-by. And I was extremely happy of the fact they facilated me by being flexible on some of their policies.Excellent staff .The food is very good and amazingly of good value. The room was airy ,  very clean and well designed to make you feel so much comfortabe. Loved every minute of the stay. They know what it takes to make it in a highly competitive leisure sector and looks like they are on their way to become one of go to places in it.
"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was excellent..no words 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was amazing  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The beds were extremely comfortable and the staff were wonderful!Though the hotel was just 1 week in operation, we enjoyed every moment of it!My only disappointment was with a cocktail I ordered which was not up to my expectation. But generally everything else were very good. Bar Service."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The ambiance was excellent The only thing i notice is your bathroom door which cannot be closed. if its a couple staying in a room it wouldn't be a become a problem if it's a bachelour's staying it will be uncomfortable
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Overall is good. Nice and clean room. Many choices for breakfast. Gym is brilliant. It’s really like a real gym with many machines and weight training space. And the view is super nice. The staffs are nice and helpful. However, seems like all functions don’t connect together. For example, transportation, when making booking, the reception said just went directly to the vehicles counter. And yes, I paid directly to at vehicles counter and got receives. But when I checked out, when the hotel receives show the room price and some transportations which are not all. The worst is, I order dinner from room service one day. When a staff delivered food, he said I could pay him directly now or could pay later when I checked out. So I paid to that staff and asked for receive. He said I could get receive from reception when I check out. But when I check out, no meal price shows on receive. So i asked for that and the reception replied there’s no information from the kitchen. I asked them to track back as I need to get receive for company’s reimbursement. They said they couldn’t find it because it was 3 days passes already. As I need to leave to the airport, so they asked for my e-mail and said they will check with account tant department and will send me receive later. But until now, I still haven’t got it. I think it’s a little confuse how each departments operate and link to one another. And I really have no idea if the hotel got my money for food or that staff just took the money for himself. Anyway, apart from this, overall are good and I’m satisfied here. For sure next times I would come back and stay here. Just know now I better pay everything at reception or ask to get receive in the same time I pay for things."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The staff at the hotel were very friendly & helpful, esp at the Travel desk & restaurant. The buffet breakfast spread was also quite good. Bed comfort excellent, and bathrooms good. The food was unsatisfactory (except the buffet breakfast) All the meals ordered were served cold, which is no good, as curries , rice & veggies need to be served hot. (The Sri Lankan meals) The spaghetti was very unsatisfactory. Served cold & in a soup bowl which made it extremely uncomfortable for eating."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The staff were all really friendly and attentive, check in was easy.  Room service was great, the hotel was quiet enough. I didn't like that you had to put a deposit down before staying and couldn't just pay your bill at the end.... also you should really have some umbrellas by the pool area to create more shade, the pool area is beautiful but hard to enjoy if you know you're going to get really sun burnt.  The trees do not offer enough cover, so unfortunately I couldn't enjoy the pool area at all which is something I'd been excited about."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Overall everything was good Restaurant service was too slow
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The proficiency of the barman in Tides Bar willing to make a cocktail (Negroni) not in the system!
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Its a brand new property with an amazing infinity pool The location is slightly tricky, and takes little time to reach from narrow lanes."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Thank  Mary!!!! You are a star!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Yes, the pastries were really good.  The bed could have been more comfortable. We had dinner only once.  Was rather disappointed with food we ordered."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Marino Beach Colombo reflects decency, professionalism, friendliness, diplomacy, coolness and convenience that every traveler rightly needs. It is priced affordably but the luxury of accommodation is its equivalent.You exceeded my expectation. Now, I am your advertizer. There will be more people coming to Colombo because of your hotel. God bless you MBC.Paulo I did not like to leave your hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Pool Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great location, new rooms, well priced. Good food, fantastic pool "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"location is ok, 15~20 min to fort section by tuktuk. staffs are very polite and nice. pool is great especially at sunset. I reserved airport shuttle taxi and paid for fee at hotel. But taxi driver asked me to pay again at the airport."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Newly built property, every thing is exceptional. Specially the pool"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Staff at the front desk were very helpful, especially when it came to booking transport for our excursions. Our room was fantastic. The selections of tea were great. The rooftop pool and jacuzzi area looked just as amazing as they do in the pictures. There wasn’t a lot to do in the immediate vicinity. When it came to dining it was much cheaper to venture out and you could eat more authentic Sri Lankan food. However it was only a reasonably short tuk tuk or taxi ride away to explore inner Colombo"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Great hotel in a wonderful country. There are a couple of quirks that show that it was opened quickly - signs not quite straight etc...but that added to the charm of the place. Loved it!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The staff found out it was my birthday and had a cake made for me! They were so nice and it was a wonderful surprise! Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"CleanlinessVery clean hotel None"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Its a fresh new hotel just opened recently everything was perfect,starting from reception, restaurant and fitness center. The swimming pool has amazing view. Off course we don't forget the all most smiling staff and responsible ladey in the restaurant. Lastly at the evening time i enjoyed  life music from the piano was really charming.  . Only one thing the wc door made from transparent glass so y have to be careful every time other wise y will kick yrself by the door. I think it's better to be removed"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Infinity pool to see sunsets is amazing! 
Staff very nice and helpful. They take care of you, no matter what. 
Great experience! If we go back to Colombo we will come back!  Everything was great.
"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very classy hotel, UK plug points. The chandelier is special. Room service very attentive. At the breakfast buffet, ability to choose your food and room service will deliver it.  We checked in king room for 3 persons, but room only prepared for 2. We had to request the extra bed + extras which were missing from the room for our child/ third person. In the off season, no dinner buffet only al a carte - prices very reasonable."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Infinity pool , room, view , breakfast  Staff is not professional for the luxury hotel standards "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The facilities are outstanding and very new. The pool is one of the best I have ever seen around the world.  Staff may be better trained to provide a better service. Communication is difficult at some times. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Overall a true 5 star hotel. Everything from the room, staff , the gym, the pool were excellent. Breakfast had an awesome spread.   Nothing there to dislike"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Near to the city
 The view out of the window is horrible.
You only see dirt and builders. Not a nice view for a top hotel in town "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Pool is amazing! Staff are exceptional. Very happy with the hotel.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"
- very nice stuff, stunning pool area
- resonable priced room service and airport drop (just need to book in advance)
- very good value for money
- plenty of shopping possibilities near the hotel 
- balconies should be improved
- it would be nice to add hair conditioner in bathrooms"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Best place to stay in Colombo. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The roof top pool was awesome! Buffet breakfast was great too! Gym was fabulous and brand new! Great hotel, would love to return again. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Staff were exceptional
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Superb location & cleanliness The quantity of food served in Ala Carte was so less & costly in that proportion!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff were very helpful, everything was just fantastic. There wasn’t anything I didn’t like, I just thought maybe don’t be so tough on the staff in the dining room, they are doing really well, and maybe it could be slightly a little bit more relaxed."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Superb advanced technology.Superb JimSuperb swimming pool and roof top environment."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Needed to pay cash every time I ordered food from in room dining which was disappointing.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"the Hotel is brand NEW. the rooms are large and well designed, the bathrooms are large and very well equipped. the staff are very well trained all smiles and concerned that your stay is a positive experience. The breakfast was plentiful and tasty. the place is spotless. the bonus is the 58 meter pool on the roof, AMAZING! as is the super modern gym. the place is so cheap that back packers are staying there!my fear is that the word will get out and it will be difficult to get a room. so get in while it is still relatively unknown. leaving!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Practically, every thing (service etc) were excellent."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool on the roof
The fabulous breakfast I had, the variety and food equality is great Safebox problem in the rooms.
Our room has a safe box, but it is not connected to the wall.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Infinity pool The mini bar they offer you with the room is hilarious. 3 bottles of pepsi
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Overall service was excellent  New hotel n just small issues. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Good Hotel 👍🏻 , connected with Marino Mall. Poor facilities on the roof. They could use the amazing potentials of rooftop facilities. It would be better if they use carpets in rooms."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Mary at the check in was very nice. She knew how to solve problems and was excellent at making you feel welcome. The fitness center is well equipped and spotless. The fitness instructor is very courteous and helpful. The infinity pool is very nice. Not all check in staff are good. Some dont make you feel welcome. During my first night I was not accompanied by someone to help me with my luggage, locate my room or give an overview of the facilities in the room. After my complain, the lobby manager came up himself and apologised. I was later upgraded."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel just opened a few months ago. The facilities are brand new and fantastic. Staff are really friendly.The view from the hotel is amazing. You can enjoy sun set and sun rise from either restaurant or pool.Infinite pool.Food price is very reasonable.Airport transfer is 15 USD. Nothing"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Will highly recommend this hotel. The staff went out of their way to make things comfortable. Special Mention to Faye from the Tides restaurant. I travel to Colombo once in 2 months and the facilities, cleaniliness and service exceeds so many of the the 5star hotels in Colombo. The food is great and the pricing is extremely affordable compared to other well-established hotels. Please keep up the great work! Will be back soon!"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,payment isn't really clear
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Modern Architecture  Balcony structure as it was least private. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Brand new property. There’s a mall in the same building that can be accessed from within the hotel. Lavish breakfast spread. All Rooms have an attached balcony.  The all night menu is very limited.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The swimming pool is amazing, specially watching the sunset over the Indian oceanThe room service is very good.Breakfast with a vast choice.There is a tour information service in the lobby which helps you to know the tourist attractions and any extra information about that. The lobby could be better designed and furnished.The staff are polite but could be more friendly.The extra bed was not comfortable enough; but according to my request, they attenuated hardness of the mattress by adding some extra layers of linen."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Overall a very comfortable stay. Its a Brand New Hotel and the Promoters had spent lavishly to make sure their guests have a great stay at their Hotel. The Lobby could have been designed Better. Lobby did not go well because of poor lighting.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Swimming pool very good & all the facilities are new & comfortable Food can be improved more
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Absolutely amazing team working there despite it being a brand new hotel. Quick to respond, efficient and overall a pleasure to speak to about Sri Lanka, life, everything. Very friendly. Special shout out to: Suneth the concierge manager who went above and beyond to take care of us and Prashant our very patient driver who put up with our adventurous whims during a day trip. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"At Rs. ~20k (B&B) for a 5 star hotel in heart of Colombo is a steal. The rooms are new and immaculate, mini bar is complementary, one of the best inifinity pools I've come across in SL.
 The dinner buffet, I found the dessert options a bit lacking, but overall the spread was decent."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Beautiful hotel, great rooms, comfy beds, great pool area. Front reception staff were not as professional or friendly as we had found elsewhere."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,clean and modern hotel with good service and responsive staff Not  much choice with the dinner menu. Lot of gusts expect good Sri Lankan food choices. TV doesn't have international or English channels.As a tourist  I expect to see some international news in BBC or CNN..Since we don't understand the native  .
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The infinity pool was amazing Not much to dislike. The property is amazing and when it fills up, I hope the staff can keep up to the demand."

Very well equipped gym.The hotel is connected to the mall which has a very affordable food court if you decide to eat outside the hotel.Treated very well by staff Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The room was spacious and comfortable. Exactly what we expected. The breakfast buffet was really good. There were so many varieties and tasted good. Hope they will maintain these standards in the future as well. The infinity pool had a great view and we went early in the morning and had the whole pool to ourselves. The lift from the car park to the lobby is switched off after 10pm it seems. We had to walk all the way from the car park.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The food was amazing, the bathroom and rooms were very clean and big."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,great breakfast nice infinity pool on rooftop
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I loved everything about my stay at Marino Beach Hotel. From the second my toddler and I arrived at the hotel, the lobby manager, Dilsha, ensured we were well taken care of. This is one of the best 5 star hotels in the world. The staff are so friendly and you can literally eat of the grounds, that's how clean this place is. Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,staff was super friendly and i  celebrated my bdy there. They brought the cake on exact time and ddnt even charge for it. Super clean rooms and excellent food with so many variations for breakfast. highly recommend this to anyone.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Swimming pool and from tide bar connection to the mall is good way for purchased something nice foods,  clean & luxurious in this price. City views and ocean view beautiful from room & from rooftops.   Nothing (services charges & taxes 30% are too much on everything from water to foods and living,  I suggest they should offer 30% discount so paying taxes doesn't matter)  "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Nice stay.... Very good hotel...
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I loved the staff. They were super friendly and so kind. The hotel was spotless clean. I highly recommend this hotel. Will be back again, hopefully. 
A huge thanks to Ms Diluka (sorry if I got your name wrong) for taking great care of me while I thought I was ""stuck"" in the elevator and panicked. All the staff are lovely and full of smiles! ♡ Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We managed to see the sun setting from our window although our room did not directly face the sea. That was a real surprise!. The bed was comfortable and the amenities great! The view from the top floor was just super! With the infinity pool and the beautifully landscaped garden with matured trees (I really don't know how they grew them there!), you can go anytime of day and admire the scenery. From here we could watch the train pass by down below, literally just beside the sea and we could just imagine the feeling of sitting in the train watching the sea go by........If you are short of time (like we were), Marino shopping centre is attached to the hotel and you can grab a bite of local food or buy something for remembrance."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Loved this hotel, amazing facilities, lovely staff and great location."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The Bed was comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. Hotel is very clean. The smell in the elevator connecting the Mall/
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great staff and service
Superb rooms great view"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Nice swimming pool and gym. Rooms are comfortable. Single bed is a little bit small for this price. This is one guy working in the hotel got us two tuk-tuk cars and told us to follow the drivers while the drivers wanted to charge us 500 LKR/per km. Even though I refuse to pay that much, it still ruined our first day in Colombo. "

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great friendly staff
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything -
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Infinity pool and spa on the rooftop was amazing. Great service from the staff - I was moved room after my TV wouldn't work. Breakfast was delicious.  Watch out for added tax on the advertised special rate.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Definitely recommend this place. Amazing bedrooms fully equipped with balcony and sea view, and the infinity pool on the roof is just crazy. Very helpful and nice staff. Thank you !"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,It actually was elegant. The rooms were really comfortable.  The finishing of the balcony doors are abit cheap looking for the quality of the hotel. But that was out trumped by the confort. And the menu cards were just ordinary laminated paper. Which needs to be updated to match the style of the restaurant. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Clean, new and modern. Bars and restaurants, good prices! Easy taxi."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Nice place, new and fun Foyer too big and doesn't feel homely, but understand the ""tour group"" long view. Rooftop could be better livened up with a bar or lounge"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"This is one of those rarest hotels where the owners got the property and also the staff right. This is a beach facing property located in a prime location. All the facilities listed on the site are top notch, which is expected since this is a brand new property. The staff is what makes this hotel worth visiting again. Starting from the doorman, everyone is very friendly and helpful. Staff goes above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Although rooms and bath rooms are not too spacious, they are very comfortable. I am hoping that the service stays the same when I visit this property next time. Intercom service could be improved, giving out clear numbers or switches for reception, restaurant and maintenance could remove the confusion while using it. Currently I had to call the dining service for all the problems, which then gets routed to the concerned department."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The property was just amazing and so luxurious. I really could not fault anything. Every member of staff went out of their way to accommodate needs and make you feel so special, the staff are really the essence of what made my stay so nice. Also not to mention the amazing bedrooms and infinity pool. We spent three nights there and a 10/10 for our stay. I will most definitely be back! Absolutely nothing, I could not find one bad thing to say honestly."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The reception helped me for a late check out.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Very good, pleasant, unobtrusive service. Amazing rooms, gorgeous views from the balcony. Delicious breakfast with a huge selection of cuisines and dishes.Pool, garden and jacuzzi on the roof - awesome!Next time in Colombo I'll live only here."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It`s a brand new hotel , the comfort off the room is verry good . The rooftop pool is amasing . The food in the restaurants was ok , but they dont serve it at the same time . Stay away from the chinese restaurant , the food there is awful ."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"On asking for a new bed for 3 people in a room, we were given a comfortable single bed. The staff were amazing and quick to respond! If you are booking for 3 in 1 room, note that the original extra bed is not for an adult. This wasn't clear at the time of booking so just take note. The roof top pool is incredible!  The original third bed in a booking for 3 is a small pull out / child's bed that is not comfortable "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Every thing is good 😘😘 i am so happy to enjoy the hotel.  Really staff was cooperative , every thing was so good "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Modern, convenient and functional Breakfast was poor. Some of the food was cold."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Facilities are good
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Location Menu is very limited
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It's super luxury .worth for money you spent .room was spacious Sea view was disturbed by nearby buildings 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Food was great, breakfast buffet was very good, spacious rooms with floor to ceiling window, infinity roof TOP Swimming pool, location is beautiful Check in was very slow, stuff needs training , not there yet. When I asked for the extension for one more night after staying 5 nights I was asked to move to twin room as I paid for this type of room which was 10 dollars cheaper. They were willing to move me for 1 night to different room category or charge my 10 dollars extra instead of offering it for free  not to give a guest a hassle packing and moving."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Nice place, very new hotel. Location is good. Roof top pool is superb, great value for money In this prices they should include breakfast"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"- Great rooms with fantastic view

- The first diesel trains start at 5 am, the railway line is just in front of the hotel"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Very comfortable modern hotel with an amazing pool and great balcony views.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"the infinity pool is my favorite aspect of the whole hotel. decent in-room dining. friendly and helpful staff. the location of the hotel is very convenient as most hot-spots in colombo are within walking distance (such are Gallery Cafe in Paradise road & the Barefoot (both of which are a must when visiting colombo.I loved that the hotel is connected to a mall, very convenient if you needed to buy things you forgot to pack and/or need once you're there.the bed is very comfortable, bedding is clean and soft, the overall hygiene of the room and hotel is quite excellent.definitely will consider staying there again for my next visit to colombo it's quite tricky to get into the hotel by foot through the mall past 10pm when the mall closes, you either have to go under the parking (which is your safe option as you're escorted by security) or would have to go through dark allies to get to the main entrance (not recommended)."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff really were excellent right from the very start when we were welcomed by 'J' the General Manager, who had such a warm friendly manner. The hotel is new and luxurious with some great attention to detail such as multi adaptor plug sockets in the room! A fabulous pool and a great bar upstairs on the roof with Dhanu looking after us like Royalty. The restaurant was excellent with very professional service especially from Gokul our young waiter. Food was very good and contrary to what others have said, good value. I can't understand comments about it being expensive? Dinner and wine was cheaper than eating out on our own high street. You really would be delighted staying here but don't expect a walk down to the beach as there isn't one as such. Can't think of a thing negative about this place"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great staff, views and service"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool is amazing, beds are so comfy, staff are really friendly and helpful, everything was really clean, the room was spacious, the bathroom was amazing (great shower), piano guy in the lobby was great.

The hotel was over my expectations but I prefer more helpful and polite in the recepion when I ask about adaptor for European electricity"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It was just amazing. I just wish I stayed more days. Having the mall next door makes things so convenient.  Well done  Nothing negative 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Location and service were amazing and the hotel experience was the best so far of all my travel from Thailand, Dubai, and Amsterdam.
Best infinity pool ever. Spa facility wasn't available at that point of time"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel is very new, and location is fantastic. The infinity pool is to die for! My parents and i had a wonderful time there. The room is relatively new so still smells of furnishment a little bit."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The hotel is new, modern and clean. The room is clean, spacious and pleasant. There is not much of a beach in front of the hotel. It is a bit of a walk to the main beach along Galle road closer to Dutch house but a tuk tuk does the work"

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The room size and the bathroom facilities You have to pay immediately for any service you order . Not being able to sign the bills was a minus .To avoid this you have to keep a deposit of 50 USD per day on your checkin. Room service food portion size is small compared to what you pay.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The hotel and staff were fantastic, everything was very clean, the pool was amazing and the food was great too - lots to choose from. We especially appreciated the reasonable costs of the food and drinks for a 5* hotel, they had not been inflated like other 4 or 5* properties - don’t change this. The building works outside the hotel - not the hotel’s fault but it was noisy and unpleasant."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Infinity pool and terrace garden   Lobby design could have been better 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Everything was good. Nothing to complain. Good food, great courtesy, soothing environment and helpful staffs. My stay was memoriable. I would suggest this place to my friends and family. You should go to the place atleast once. Some of the guests made a lot of noise at night. If only they could give admission to worthy guests. I guess that would be biased. But some annoying guests could make your night horrible. Admission only to presentable guests to maintain their image would be great."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Location is great close proximity to all Colombo must see places. pool was good. Facility is new and clean. staff is friendly and trained well. Recommends. Shopping mall also not bad. Value for money spent.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent staff 
Very kind and helpful 
The lobby was spectacular 
The room was outstanding 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Very clean and comfortable.. Everything was good
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The rooftop pool itself is a winner. Well designed and maintained. The rooms are spacious, very clean and well above local standards. The ocean views are amazing. Beds, pillows and towels are soft and very clean. Bathroom amenities are plenty and good quality. Big screen and apple tv/netflix is a big plus (although we don’t watch tv while travelling). Tea/coffee selection in the room is very satisfactory and the complimentary minibar is another nice touch. The staff was very helpful, friendly and professional. The location is not close to the center (the lake) but close to other attractions like shopping centers. There is a mall accessible by elevator from hotel lobby which is also a great advantage. Uber is super convenient in Colombo so don’t even bother to stay anywhere more central than this, you can go anywhere with a 5-10 min ride. The lobby could be designed a bit warmer. It doesn’t properly reflect what is inside the hotel. The restaurants in the hotel are good but not the best. Slow service, unpleasant food are not unseen. Nothing to worry about though, just call an uber and you aill be at the best restaurants in town in 10mins."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Staff very welcoming and professional. Mary from the front desk in particular 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The staff and the cleanliness of the place plus the Infinity pool
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Landed there after a long flight what an amazing hotel the pool is to die for loved it that much booked for few more days at the end of are trip well worth splashing out on
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The best hotel in our trip in Sri-Lanka! All was great. Pool in the roof, room with all needed staff, cool bathroom, really amazing! We ordered food and it was very good as well! Piano in the evening in hotel lobby...fantastic!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The pool Check out was 12 and we got few minutes delayed and the key card stopped working immediately.. we couldn't even get into the room or use the elevator with out the help of room service
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Great rooftop infinity pool and gym.  Fresh rooms. Breakfast buffet could do with a bit of work.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Stayed for one night with my daughter and the hotel was excellent. The rooms were well appointed and very high class (I think the hotel opened in August 2018). The staff were very friendly and helpful. And the pool lovely and picturesque. The main highlight was the dining experience at Tides Restaurant which had a great selection of food and a lovely ambiance; the staff were great with us and very attentive. Would highly recommend and will hopefully stay again when in Colombo I can't think of a thing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This is an excellent hotel.. the room was cleaned very well.. staffs are very friendly and helpful, namely Madame Dilshani from Guest relations and her manager Mr. Ravi. Marino Beach Hotel is lucky to have them in the team. They can handle any situation well. If you have any issues or any sort of arrangements which needs to be taken care off, (like honeymoon, birthday, anniversary..etc) Madame Dilshani is the one. 
Sunset is great from the 10th floor. In room dining, Chinese restaurant and the snacks and bite bar upstairs is excellent. I highly recommend this place to all travelers who go to Colombo. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Hotel is brand new. Good size comfortable room. Good location on the seafront road and next to the shopping mall. Quite good breakfast. The best feature is the roof top garden and infinity pool - very good size pool, excellent design with sunbeds in little bays surrounded by water and magnolia trees lining up the side of the pool.  Spacious bathroom, particularly liked fancy large mirror with inbuilt side lights activated by touching the little blue circle on the mirror itself. Inexperienced and poorly trained staff - it took me 20 minutes to check in after flying overnight and around 15 minutes to check out, due to mistakes in the final bill. Housekeeping was also not up to the standard expected - while the room was cleaned and the bed made, there was no replenishment of toiletries in 4 days. Trousers handed over for dry cleaning, as clearly market on the form, were returned machine washed. Another unpleasant surprise was that minor daily costs could not be charged to the room - the hotel demanded pre-authorization of accidental expenses only using credit card. I traveled on business and used the company card for payments, which was debit card, and it was inconvenient to pay room charges for the whole stay on check-in and settle accidental expenses individually on spot.  It is not nice that priority is given to prompt payments and not to the comfort of guests.The hotel is incomplete and construction is ongoing, which is evidenced by distant drilling and hummering noises. Some features in the room are of poor design, poor quality or poorly done - only two sockets for the entire double room and the sockets are of poor quality so that they do not hold plugs properly; unmarked drop in floor level (about 5 cm) between the room and the bathroom is a hazard and so is entrance door stopper (metal)  located about 20 cm from the edge of the wardrobe - it is very easy to injure foot on these features; cracked or lose tiles in the bathroom, entrance door not closing automatically and couple of other things which you do not see in high standard hotels, giving attention to details. May give this hotel another try in the future, once it is fully completed, but not guaranteed."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very nice spacy room, clean. We appreciated mini bar for free. breakfast was ok, we were sitting on balcony and looking to the sea, which was amazing for us. And the pool on the roof was just perfect, it reminds us pool in Singapore Marina Bay sands. Staff very helpful, especially with booking taxi service. Really great experience, recommend this hotel. - a little bit noisy because of building new hotels or houses near hotel marino beach"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Food was delicious, morning buffet and room service was great.Rooms were comfortable"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Infinity pool and rooms. None
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Total comfort, rooftop infinity pool, Comfy bed"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.5 ,Everything During check in was not informed if you shop in their mall you get 10 percent discount
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,The pool was fabulous
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"They organised an efficient airport pick up
Hotel was spotlessly clean
Infinity pool on the roof Some wierd design flaws in the room could be dangerous.  A step down into the shower turn the glass shower door into a guillotine for a foot in the wrong place.  A step up from the bathroom to the bedroom that remains unexpected even after 2 days stay."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"I really liked the fact that the hotel was situated and gave direct access to the Marino Mall. It helped a lot in doing shopping and finding good locations for restaurants. Really enjoyed the room as it had all the facilities for a comfortable stay such as iron, scale,very spacious room, bath tub  all rooms have balcony with sea view. A very good 5 Star hotel with excellent staffs."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The best thing about our stay in Colombo was Marino Beach. The staff were super friendly, the rooms were immaculate and breakfast was superb! Great variety. Loved the rooftop bar and the infinity pool. Highly recommended."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,good service and perfect foods its damn good.i recommend this place
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It’s a brand new hotel. The staff were great, the rooms are spotless and spacious and we loved the rooftop pool.  Nothing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The pool was to die for ... 
The staff was very helpful and the hotel was clean and the mini bar treats were free and had a nice few snacks."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It's a new 5 star, so Very reasonable in price right now. How wonderful? Great pool and boardwalk on the terrace.It is self sufficient with the Marino Mall adjoining... We went for meals to the food court there which had awesome variety of fresh food at very good rates.Couldn't have been better... we would have missed something had we not stayed here Nothing... it was perfect"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The rooftop pool offering an unforgettable view of the ocean was the highlight of our stay at Marino Beach. The staff was very hospitable and accommodating. conveniently located just minutes drive away from Dutch Hospital and Galle Face, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely visit again, soon!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The staff gave me a cake for my birthday and made my day. I loved everything
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,This new hotel crossed all our expectations. Undoubtedly 10 out of 10 in all aspects. Staff all were exceptionally courteous and helpful. Rooms exceptionally big. Wifi Speed above 40MBPS speed. I personally feel they need to increase the pricing or may be they are new that is why they kept pricing low. Nothing. One should not have any complains.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Beautiful hotel with great rooms and beds. The rooftop pool and restaurants were amazing! Except for the reception thing in the beginning the staff were all very helpful and nice. We arrived in a hurry because my friend was sick and we needed somewhere to stay, she wasn’t aloud to stay in the room while I went to get the passports (at our previous place), I understand the policy but it would have been nice if they offered a room since she was sick and we could have payed and left credit cards as insurance. We then asked if we could see the rooftop (and check out the reataurant) before we left to get the passports, but we weren’t aloud to do this either."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,What a place !! Book here before the prices go up. New hotel. You must eat here for the evening buffet...Fantastic ! Every drink and meal has Vat and service charge added....watch out
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Quality hotel with brand spanking new facilities that tick all the boxes for a very comfortable stay. 
Good sized, very well equipped, nicely designed and spotlessly clean room - including an entertaining electronic blind that can be activated to obscure view through the glass wall into the bathroom!
Rooftop infinity pool and jacuzzi were also nice. Decent enough restaurant and bar on the 2nd floor, and useful access direct into the next door shopping mall.
The staff were friendly and provided good service.
The weather was terrible when we stayed so would perhaps be more effusive if it had been sunnier. But still a very well run and professional new hotel offering a good base to explore Colombo from. Would work well for business stays as well.
 Aircon overkill throughout the hotel meant it was freezing!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It was truly a five star hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Food, Service and the cocktails were all awesome. Room and facilities were great - especially the bathroom which was spacious and well made. Jacuzzi looked so tempting but we hadn't taken our swimwear so we weren't able to try it. I wanted to check out the spa as well - next time for sure :) Roof-top restaurant could be better decorated and there should be at least TWO counters in operation at the front desk at all times or it takes time for visitors to check-in or check-out"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything is great about Marino Beach hotel Colombo. From Staff to the property and the comfort in the room. 
The rooftop pool delivered 👍"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Was a comfortable setup with good value for money  Non smoking floor smelled of smoking on one occasion 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This is a brand new hotel that is extremly clean.  The management and all the staff are genuine and strive to make your stay a nice one.  We stayed in colombo for 4 days to do some shopping before we went to Avani Bentota for the beach and resort experience.
Breakfast is good value and amazing with a lot of different cuisines. 
The VR lounge in the mall is really good.
None of the resorts in bentota come clost to match the 5star luxury of this hotel.  We were blown away at how well the room we stayed in was planned.
USB charging ports at built in to power socket.  Also have an HDMI lort that we didnt use..  WiFi has good speeds but its OPEN.
The bathroom is real 5 STAR quality.
The queen bed is super comfortable and you kmow this is a new hotel as our didnt even feel used.. Nice and super luxurious.  
I am writing this review from my Avani bentota suite and i miss the bed and bathroom from Marino.
They should change the name from Marino beach hotel to THE MARINO as the beach is inaccessable. It all about the view.  If you get a ocean view you can see beautiful sunsets as its west facing.
Overall a really good hotel.  Dont use the tuk tuk at the road in front of the hotel.  None of them are meteted and they are massive scams.  They will take you to the worst exchanges and jewellery and other shops.  use google and be firm on whefe you wanna go.
 The rooms could be bigger.  We are 2 adults and 2 kids.  We booked the ocean view Signature room with Bath tub and balcony.  They didnt have option for family suite or a larger room with 2 queen beds."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This place offers the most exquisite service. Every single staff member was extremely professional and helpful at all times. Especially when they were confronted by an arrogant and rude customer, I was very impressed. There is nothing I didn’t like about this hotel!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Super luxury rooms Arabian style interior in hotel Nothing sorry
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Roof top pool and garden is a must! It's stunning and you'll want to stay there instead of exploring the city! Rooms were comfortable with free soft drinks and snacks and breakfast buffet was good with plenty of options. Having a mall connected to the hotel is so convenient for gift shopping too! Nothing major. Room was slightly too warm and fridge didn't cool drinks too well. Called maintenance who came and tried to fix things but it only made a slight difference. A bit difficult to get bellboy to get our bags when we were checking out.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Pool and gym on the roof top Everything was good
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Stayed in Marino Beach for 3 nights during my stay in Colombo. Rooms were very clean, staff was super friendly and everything was perfect. Especially the lobby manager was very helpful. Very good experience!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It was clean, it was comfortable,the location great, the pool super! The staff was helpful and very accommodating."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The place was incredible, we will be returning when we leave Sri lanka"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Management was great about making it up to me. All the staff were super helpful.  The facilities in the room were great, real luxury.  Huge bathroom with shower and separate tub. The concierge was the only one who could arrange transportation, and he steers you toward the hotel cars, which are more expensive.  I asked him 4 times to call a taxi, while waiting 20 minutes to find a driver. He refused.
The room was advertised with ocean view, but be aware that some rooms have only a sliver from the balcony, while overlooking some ugly, rusted buildings.  "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Tasty chicken wings, satay chicken and fries at the rooftop bar and a great breakfast selection. Friendly staff and free minibar is a nice touch. The rooftop snacks took a little while but the staff came and apologised and the food was tasty when it arrived."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Outstanding gym and pool. The hotel was immaculate.  Duty manager was very good as were the concierge team.
Good location. Would like to have stayed longer. 
Rooms are great. Check in process was very long as we asked for an extra room. One of our pre booked rooms wasnt available at the hotel check in time.
Didnt think much of the breakfast to be honest."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,This is a very nice hotel to stay. The staff were so kind and the food is great.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Cleanliness, Polite Staff, Reasonable price. Flexibility"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything. 
Rooms, staff, value for money all incredible
In house taxi service and exchange rate both best in Sri Lanka.

Honestly best hotel in the country."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Nice pool, nice staff, room clean Pool was too cold and jacuzzi was not heated"

Infinity pool was amazing
Room service was really tasty and great value Internet was slow and the VPN did not work due to bad network"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Room was good. Staff were helpful when asked. Pool was fabulous. Although called Marino Beach, there wasn't a beach.
The staff didn't explain where things were in the hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Beautiful view of the ocean and the part of the city. It provides a great shopping opportunity at the adjacent Marino Mall for business travelers who may not otherwise have a chance to buy authentic Sri Lanka products. The food was extremely affordable. Definitely going back on a private visit. The noise of the maintenance work that was being done on the floor above was disturbing in the morning but when I raised the matter with the reception, work was halted until after noon."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very good restaurant for dinner (not expensive). Breakfast buffet is excellent regarding either diversity and the atmosphere of the room with option to see view. Infinite swimming pool is absolutely amazing.This is really a 5 stars hotel with low rates. Probably on of the best value for money hotels in Colombo. The location is not central as other luxury hotels but it doesn't affect the stay at all."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Friendly and helpful staff.  The location of the room and view was not so good and nice. Dusting of the room furnitures were not done properly. After check-in nobody came to escort us or show the way to our room. Very Less verities of  items in the mini bar fridge. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The cleanliness is top notch, the towels are fresh and very white. Breakfast varied and very tasty. The staff is great The railroad spoils the view, but it is not to the hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Excellent quality and choice of food. Overall standard of cleanliness. Pool superb Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Wonderful rooftop pool with great views over the city. The staff are really friendly and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Excellent
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Friendly helpful staff 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Root top pool and  garden Out door very busy
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,everything was great and also they accept late check out without payment which was great
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"excellent location, near the main shopping streets, the sea view is excellent, the roof was very nice, wow breakfast (actually it is the best that I have seen in Colombo) with a lot of varieties and there is a very small nice mall on the 1st floor. The room was very spacious and quiet. The travel desk prices is way above the market rates. The coffee shop at the lobby closes at 10:00PM."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Everything was fine, clean comfy and at a good location  there's actually nothing not to like, but the hotel doesn't have a spa yet which is a bummer "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Clean, staff, rooms, roof, amazing hotel "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Location, amenities,pool. Everything "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I liked everything..... The staff is very good the food was good too the place and the view was good and the pool was breath taking. U need to sleep there to know how good it is.  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Great pool. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This hotel is amazing. The rooms were really nice, very modern and clean. The views weren’t great from our balcony but we could still see the sea! If you want a good view just head to the sunset lounge bar here, looks right onto the beach. We watched the sunset and a cool thunderstorm one evening! We ordered room service one of the evenings too which was great. Didn’t get w chance to try either of the restaurants but they looked nice. The pool area is fantastic, although limited sun beds. We didn’t get a chance to use it due to no beds one afternoon when we were free which was a shame, but not a deal breaker for us! The staff were all very kind and helpful. Would 100% stay again. Limited number of sun beds
"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Location and the reservation method from online booking and the amenities available at the room... Not available of sea view from the room....
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Evrything is perfect No thing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Breakfast fantastic rooms clean and staff all very friendly,we could not ask for anything more beautiful, would recommend to our family and friends 10/ out of 10 all round Breakfast so much choice , pool"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Amazing!
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Really really good breakfast spread!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Nice place, came here to relax and that's definitely what I did. Infinity pool was great and the views were just as good! Gym was very nice and the food was fantastic. If I was rich I would have stayed longer, in saying that, as a student looking for a fancy hotel this was perfect and very affordable."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Great infinity pool and chill out garden. Very nice room Views from the balcony a bit disappointing. It would have been nice to be welcomed with a juice or cold drink.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Infinity roof top pool and garden area. Best curries we had in Sri Lanka. Best hotel we stayed in in Sri Lanka and also the most expensive.  Getting food and beverage bills with tax and service charge added plus a tip request !  If you add a service charge then tips do not apply. Pure greed !
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Brand new, modern facilities."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The pool is AMAZING! Rooms are very spacious, with lovely quality bedding. Great shower too.Had good meal in the Chinese restaurant. The main restaurant is buffet style. Fine for breakfast, didn't use it for evening meal."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Couldn't fault this place! Had an amazing time, staff were so helpful for anything you needed and it was a beautiful place. Wouldn't stay anywhere else"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Facilities. Roof top Garden and pools are awesome. Breakfast is well served with almost every available food option. In spite of informing in advance about my our arrival the room was not ready when we arrived.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Room comfort excellent. The telephone operator's cross questions.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything staff are lovely and the food is so yummy and the good thing there is a mall attached to it Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The staff were very welcoming. Pool area is exceptional. Rooms modern and comfortable. I would go direct for booking in the future. Estimates of cost from Wotif were a long way off.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Liked everything about the stay.
Loved the Christmas feel. 
Staff was awesome. 
The hotel oversees the sea and the railway track and we managed to get cool pictures."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"I found a variety of food , everything which I like . The taste of food was good , the presentation,  the ambiance was really good. The only thing which I didn't like was TEA."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The hotel is new and the room was very spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was great having the balcony to go out onto watch the thunderstorms (which reminded me of my childhood - where I live now we don't get those). The infinity pool is amazing and affords great views over Colombo, and the breakfast buffet certainly fills you up for the day. Despite being such a new hotel the plug mechanism in the hand basin didn't work properly, just a minor detail but not something that you should encounter in a luxury hotel that is not even six months open."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Exceptionally clean
Excellent pool, gym
Very comfortable beds, pillows, linen, slept a dream 
Loved the bath robes and slippers
Dark & quiet rooms made a conducive sleeping environment 
Rain shower, bath
Breakfast was sensational, so much food! Hotel booked a driver for us Colombo - Bentota was a bit expensive, however very convenient "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything. The cleanliness, friendly staff,  I don't think I can think of anything I did not like"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Location, pool and facilities"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The pool is incredible with amazing views. We ate in the Chinese restaurant and the food was delicious, the staff were also very courteous and helpful. The concierge booked us a taxi to our next destination and it was very easy to do. The rooms were clean and comfortable."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,A very nice room and great rooftop infinity pool. The breakfast was amazing. The location is good too.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great stay and value for money. Staff were attentive and genuine. The 10th floor facilities with infinity pool, steam room and gym were a bonus for our last night in Colombo to enjoy and relax before the long flight home. Amazing breakfast buffet also. Would come again for sure. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The highlight of marino beach is it's infinity pool, and it did not disappoint :)The hotel also boost a great lobby, sea facing restaurant and bar. There were also facilities like steam room, jacuzzi and gym. The location is prime in Colombo, most of the casino's and leisure points are in close proximity. Overall my stay was very comfortable and relaxing. There are no locks in washroom doors, it's a major concern, as one always has to worry about any staff member entering the washroom for cleanup."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The pool, service, ample towles etc Not a lot I didn't like"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amazing Clean beautiful Hotel 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amazing Hotel 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Location was good. Hotel stay was comfortable. Having a Mall in the hotel was easy. The hotel has a very strict booking policy and though I planned my stay for 5 nights, a family member passed away and had to leave after 3 nights of stay & travel out of Colombo. I had to let go of 2 nights payment ( over 200 USD). As I knew of this possibility the hotel management was alerted upon check in but they were not supportive.   "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Excellent, but expensive, breakfast.Wonderful pool and spa on the roof , with 180° sea viewsShopping mall with plenty of cheap restaurants next door, with direct access from the Hotel. Price is a bit too high for Sri Lanka. service and govt taxes are added on top (30% !).But Colombo is not a cheap capital city if you are looking for quality."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing hotel and facilities! Enjoyed the new modern gym, and the infinity pool on the roof top. Breakfast was incredible and catered to all needs, brilliant continental and local breakfast. The staff was very friendly."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very nice hotel Staff very friendly. Also once we are inside the hotel no need to go outside all faculties shopping mall food court ATM machine 4 D cinema and a games arcade all in side the hotel complex felt very safe this way. This is the only hotel I have every seen like this in Colombo In house shopping complex ATM machine games arcade and food court . Partial view rooms have reasonably good view of the sea. Infinity pool and buffet

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Rooms were beautiful and mini bar was complimentary 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Food selection was really good. The swimming pool was awesome
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Beautiful product, the room is spectacular and the ambience is great, good advantage to have so many dining options in the hotel. Team members product knowledge has to be improved and should maintain the consistency of service, noticed the staff not aware of what’s on the menu and describe it and should be more welcoming."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Perfect place At night WiFi worked not fast
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The steam room. O.U.T. O. F. T. H. I. S. W. O. R. L. D.  The bathroom not having locks ( specially when your with toddlers ) 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,This hotel is awesome in USD 100 and the view to the beach from room is mesmerizing.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Awesome facilities provided to us.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"This hotel has fantastic views of the coastline and city. Fantastic swimming pool, hot tub and bar on the tenth floor. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious and comfortable but not 100% clean. I found a slipper by the bedside from previous guest and hair on the floor. Surfaces not wiped down properly either."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We loved everything. Service was great, location was good & the food was excellent. Extremely helpful and friendly staff right from the time you step in till you leave the property. The pool is super cool and has an amazing view. This is one of the best-unexplored hotels of Colombo. A star to the crazy beautiful city. Would love to stay there again."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Roof top pool. Rooms spacious. Staff was excellent. Reasonable rate for airport shuttle. Quick reply when asking questions through booking.com. Room service was very good. Terrible rip off on the drinks at the pool. Overpriced, no alcohol in them and full of ice and nothing else. Sri Lankin part of the Buffet was ridiculously spicy. I love spice and tried every dish and the food was intolerable. The atmosphere in the restaurant was uninviting and sterile. 
Pool was very cold but I still highly recommend this hotel. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Awesome brand new hotel, spotless clean, friendly staff and on top of that a breathtaking infinity pool. If you’re looking for a stay in Colombo, stop searching... book it right now!!!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything. Especially infinity pool and service. Nothing to add.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"World class service and facilities and my birthday as well so Marino customers service has send the special birthday cake to my room as a surprise,  that was excellent and amazing 😉 thanks guys . A/C temperature need to set up at 18c in rooms , at the movement it’s 20 c can’t adjust"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The pool and reasonably priced restaurants Different timings for every bar and restaurant quite confusing.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Everything...breakfast, Wi-Fi, Room, Swimming pool and adjacent shopping mall. Close to shopping area and food court in same building. Beautiful Sea view and rooftop infinity pool."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Clean big rooms Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Best hotel I've ever stayed in. Pool on the roof is outstanding. Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The infinity pool was amazing. Everything is super clean and the staff is very helpful.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The room was really comfortable.  Having a huge TV with decent channels right in front of the queen bed was extremely enjoyable. There was a good-sized work desk and also a lounging couch area which added to the comfort level in the room.  The toilet was big, clean, and with a good shower system and bathtub.  The hotel breakfast was also one of the better ones we had in Sri Lanka. The hotel had provided a recycled shaver (with hair caught in the blades).  This was probably a mistake but still not one which seemed easy to make.  Also, the price of taxis and airport shuttle service seemed to fluctuate substantially, towards the higher side, depending on when you asked and who you asked.  The check-in and check-out process was also generally slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was pitch perfect No cons
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"We had 2 stays at the hotel at the start and finish of our trip and thought the facilities were very good and the staff fantastic and eager to help.The pool was amazing.Special thanks to Dinush Thiyagarajan Lobby Manager for his helpful assistance and going above and beyond to assist us and make our stay all the better.Will definitely recommend the hotel and will stay there again for sure. Regards, Kevin and family"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"From our room, we saw a ladies bra in side the wardrobe and it disgusted me a lot, but the staff came and apologized. But next time please check all the drawers and the wardrobe properly."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Clean, excellent facilities and service. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Can tell new, as still systems are being worked out, and some small things missing from room"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The hotel pool is one of the best anywhere in the world from the top 5 star hotels. We have travelled extensively and can truly say that the pool and rooftop area is worth the price of admission alone. The hotel itself is luxurious and well decorated. Think Shangri-la. Excellent gym and breakfast. The attached Marino mall is also a great place to shop. The prices are not far off and in some instances even better than surrounding less savoury locations. Staff were ok. Some were good but generally average. They definitely didn't match the rest of the hotel's high standard.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"good staff, good view from roof top pool."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Pool Staff could be more professional 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The infinity pool was amazing and so was the breakfast spread. The hotel has a great location and lot of food options around it as well. Curry pot and Pilawoos are a must visit No complaints!

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Swimming pool, view from the room, breakfast, staffs.... all Hotel is nice but, there is no beach facilities."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"I had booked on a whim, needing to stay one extra night in Colombo after a business meeting in the evening, and was taken by the pictures of the pool on the roof.  What a great choice; absolutely delightful, and so comfortable!  Breakfast (the only meal taken) was magnificent, and might be the main reason to return for my next visit.Service can be a little slow in the lobby, but this again is very understandable, as they have only been open for a couple of months.Best wishes to the whole team for the festive season, and see you in the new year! Only minor niggles for me:  no place to plug in a hair dryer in front of a mirror (without pulling another appliance plug out - me being pedantic, sorry!), and the AC inside the restaurant at breakfast was somewhat overpowering.  I understand why; it's hot work in there, and I did enjoy sitting on the balcony, even in the gale-force winds.  Perhaps a blind of some kind to reduce the effects of heavy winds?"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Bed comfy .....  spacious rooms.. Breakfast choice not enough
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Food :) and the swimming pool. Nothing .. it was all good :)
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The room was marvelous.Furniture, and other assessories were excellentBath room and bath assessories were excellent Rooms are having side view of Sea, front side rooms are not available most of the timeStaff is very slow, it took more than an hour to allocate the room"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Had a wonderful stay at Marino beach, the staff were really helpful and the room which was huge, was beautifully furnished. The hotel is a little bit out of the centre but you can easily get a tuk tuk or taxi in which can be arranged at the travel desk. The infinity pool is just amazing! And so nice to come back to after a busy day sightseeing in Colombo. We didn’t have breakfast or dinner but had some snacks and drinks in the bar which were good. I thought it was fairly priced for Colombo which is generally much more expensive than the rest of Sri Lanka. Would definitely stay here again. There was some building work going on outside but to be honest that is pretty much everywhere in Colombo and you couldn’t hear it once the patio door was shut."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Swimming pool, foods, most amazing beautiful oceanic front views, luxuries living and completely relaxation, perfect room service and professional house keeping, thanks to Mr. Sampath on 6th floor was a very co-op house keeping expert.  Everything is perfectly excellent here. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great location, view and great breakfast! breakfast experience ! super."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The breakfast buffet was amazing, so many things to choose from and it changed every day!! The pool was a delight and a good temperature for swimming. The room had a nice bathroom with a bathtub that you could watch TV from as you could push a button and the divider between the bathroom and bedroom would come up (there was still glass there to prevent slashing). The hotel can organize a driver to take your around to all the spots at a reasonable price, we had Roshan who was very knowledgeable and ensured we had a good time. I arrived quite late in the evening and my sister has already checked into the room. When I went to reception to get my room key instead of checking my ID they called my sister at 130am to confirm even though the booking was in my name. Some signage on how to use the steam room would be helpful as we couldn’t figure out what buttons did what, this was the case for another couple who was there at the same time as us."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Servisas Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,I liked that it was near the sea. The restaurant on top floor was very good. Food excellent and good value. View from swimming pool was great. Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Amazing pool, good location, nice views of sea and train track! Grrrreat breakfast! All good, although a little pricey but well worth it!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,All clean and great staff
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Gym and swimming pool Breakfast was average 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"You get a lot of hotel for the price, especially when comparing to other 5-star hotels.  The beds are too short. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,I feel staffs could have been more friendlier than now.  They have been not friendly with locals as they do with foreigners.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The best hotel in Colombo. Everything was great! Breakfast is good, pool on the roof is great (even if you return to the hotel late, it’s open till 10), rooms are clean and comfortable.  The view from the room is on building which is under construction, so it’s not very nice and if you are staying in the room - the noise is quite annoying. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,The view was good 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff, facilities, ambience "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It was an excellent stayThw staff were superb  rge room was keot to a high standard especially cleanlinessThe in house dining was also superb All services in offer were an excellent standard I thoroughly enjoyed my stay  however one minor minor complaint was i had to wait 45 mins for my room to be readyHowever i was given drinks at the desk and given a pass to relax by the poolNot really a complaint"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Rooftop infinity pool with magnificent uninterrupted views of the Indian ocean. Wow! Food is great and not expensive. Very good gym.  Clean, spacious and very comfortable. Booked again for return after our trip around Sri Lanka."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Great pool. Great breakfast.  A little out of the way

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Breakfast selection was fantastic, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the rooftop was superb Everything was great - it is just quite expensive compared to other places we stayed at"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"everything i called them and told them i want a taxi when i arrive from the airport, and they said yes. But, when i arrived no one picked me up and i had to order a taxi at 4:00 AM."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,it was beautiful place great view
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The size and facility in the room The service at front office staff a bit not full attention, she forgot to take our payment and we stood at the desk while she just chatted with another colleagues"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"excellent location with excellent customer service,The room was good, comfortable and clean.The pool are is nice."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The pool and breakfast were great. Check in process was a disaster. Lucky I had the sheets with the details. They had us with 2 single beds (booking clearly said one king - it was our 43rd wedding anniversary!)They had us not having breakfast - booking sheet clearly said breakfast included. The booking sheet had the final price but they wanted more - firstly claiming that the sheet didn't include the tax on breakfast then the exchange rate. Booking in could not have been less considerate. It was a disaster - after that things were okay."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Clean, comfortable (especially king size bed!) and very nice furnished room with GREAT infinity pool, yakuzi, garden and bar on the top floor of hotel! Shopping mall right next to hotel. There are no beaches - u have to travel out of the Colombo and coffee was just average (but u can call it higher middle in terms of Sri Lanka coffee offer in general). But both are not hotel's fault."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"They have upgraded me during these busy days, I highly appreciated the management of Marino Beach Hotel, I would like to say thanks, delicious foods, highspeed wifi, most luxurious living, beautiful ocean view, wonderful swimming pools help me a lot, so therefore I continues another couple of nights afterward first booking, I wish I could lives here until my life :) they are always best and excellent. I love Marino Beach and would love keep coming back. I lov'n it. Why everything is perfect here always :)"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I was on the 5th floor. Even up there I was kept up by music from the lobby floor till past midnight when they had functions
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"5-star hotel with a great value for money. The pool on the roof is incredible"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,The check in process was very lengthy.  There was only one person for check in and a long line. More people would have been needed.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Absolutely amazing beautiful hotel with the friendliest staff.
The hotel was spotlessly clean, the room was really lovely with a super comfy bed, massive TV with loads of channels. Bathroom was great, shower was great with fantastic water pressure, high class toiletries provided. 
Amazing rooftop with the pool and bar with stunning views, the best pool I have ever seen. 
Food was fantastic and prices were very reasonable. 
There is nothing bad that could be said about this hotel, the staff go out of the way to make sure you are well looked after. 
The airport pick up was perfect after a long flight from the U.K. (I would definitely recommend it)"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Very nice clean and spacious rooms with a huge  sea facing balcony. I mean a 10 meter balcony that wraps around the room! Very good buffet restaurant serving many Asian and Sri Lankan dishes. Very friendly staff and the best thing of all the most beautiful rooftop pool and lounging area. 100% recommend this hotel to all 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Pool & modern facility

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amazing staff and very comfortable rooms. The breakfast was breathtaking.

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The room, its planning, the architecture, the facilities, the lobby, the corridors, the ambience everything has been tastefully done. The owner, the architect and the Engineer have done their best and the product reflects their clean, pure intent generosity and hardwork. POOR FRONT DESK SERVICE, POOR COMMUNICATION SKILLS, POOR MANNERISMS, UNENTHUSIASTIC APPROACH OF THE HOTEL STAFF EXCEPT FOR THE POOL SIDE."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The room, service from room staff and pool area  Area around"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Everything was great - the pool, clean rooms with a fab view, great food both at the restaurant and through room service. Stay here for a very relaxed time. Checking out was very delayed - I stood for 25 minutes before being served, and only after I have complained to a passing staff member. Need to streamline the processes at the front desk. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Perfect room, friendly staff, easy check in.  We were there for a very short stay, so did not see all facilities. The hotel seems to be in a developing area of the city with works going on around it. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The hotel was impeccably clean, and shower was the best we've had in Sri Lanka, the bath was a welcome surprise as well.
The breakfast buffet is really well worth going for, has a brilliant selection and did us right up until dinner.
We also found the staff to be very friendly to a person, which made us feel very welcome. Also, getting access to the pool after check out was a nice gesture. Came up to the pool everyday and could barely get a sun lounger. There's about two dozen for a hotel with hundreds of rooms, and the pool is supposed to be the main attraction. There is a big sun deck which is empty, and having to throw our stuff down onto the floor to go for a swim is well below the standard I was expecting.
For a hotel that charges these prices to be so tight when it comes to pool facilities is really poor.
WiFi in our room was very weak, and I thought having their own android TV system which had only 50 or so channels was a cheap option when comprehensive cable TV should be the norm in a place that advertises itself as a top hotel.
The previously advertised Christmas 'Gala' was just some additional items on a dinner buffet that's 30USD a night, we decided to go to another hotel for Christmas Dinner.
We booked it as a special Christmas present and in all honesty we were underwhelmed given the price we paid."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The bed was extra comfy. The pool was amazing. I loved the overall experience
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Amazing swimming pool and hotel terrace is so good one piece entire Colombo Not hot water in bathtub,  Service in the room is too late..... but okay"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,It is nice hotel with great view to the sea，esp. at the swimming pool. The hotel is also coonect to a shopping mall.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amazing 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything that matters was perfect. Lifts took a lot of time to get to the floor.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Lovely reception. Rooms large and comfortable. Lovely pool on roof with garden and bar. We had to wait 4 hours in reception before we could get in room as we arrived early due to flight change. Area is a bit rundown due to the amount of building work going on. Noisy due to building work in area.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"no comments everything okay, I requested for late checkout also allowed.. good location good staff, receptionist Ms. Nelum outstanding ... looking forward to go again nothing all good!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The infinity swimming pool was out of the world. The staff was very courteous. Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We enjoyed our stay at the Marino beach hotel specially the staff at the restaurant at the tides were very friendly polite and cheerful! The following staff were very hospitable Thiwanka, Ashan and Gyoma from tides restaurant were very hard working. Super friendly and hospitable. Promote these guys! The lifts were too slow... "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The location - very close to the attractions as well as train station and good restaurants.
The infinity pool was great and clean.
Breakfast rich and tasty with lots of varieties.
Buffet dinner tasty as well.
Tea selection in the room was also nice.
Comfortable bed. The iron in the room was dirty so I suggest to clean it before someone damage their clothes.
The AC was set to too low and even if we tried to set it on higher temperature, it did not help because everytime we left the room, the temperature dropped to freezing cold again. 
The materials used in the hotel must have been very expensive, yet the lack of maintenance and lack of sense for detail is very obvious, again. 
What I do not like in these 4 and 5* hotels all around Asia is that they charge western prices and try to offer the same service, yet they do not know how to clean properly and deliver. 
The room seemed nice but the shower was filthy dirty like the housekeepers have never used a bleach or anything (We stayed in a place 10times cheaper and the bathroom there was cleaner). 
So I suggest to find a better housekeeping supervisor - because it is not about the super shiny mirror but a clean bathroom at the end.
"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff, breakfast, facility, the pool,  They did not have late check-out!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Spotlessly clean rooms. Amazing swimming pool. Delicious food at good value for money. Staff very unhelpful and at times dishonest. We were not given the room we paid for and then changed for damages we didn’t incur. Unfortunate because it really is a beautiful hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Good location. Clean rooms. Nice views.  Inefficient staff. We had to wait for over half hour for our luggage to be sent up to our room. Also, they refuse room service unless you make a predeposit. That's not only annoying, but highly disrespectful towards the guest. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The pool was amazing and the rooms were very big The WiFi was poor. One staff member was rude when we were checking in and took a while 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Value for money.  Room size.  good view to the ocean even from the side rooms. nice pool. must have a good coffee maker. I do not like the instant coffee.  If you do not provide good coffee in the room, then must have a coffee percolator at the lobby during morning hours.  You must visit to the other 5-Star hotels to see how they provide coffee in the morning.Morning good coffee will make lot of people happy.."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Big room with a big balcony and a nice bathroom. The pool an the top is amazing expensive
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Excellent hotel with nice facility and location. Pool was wonderful. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Room and hotel facilities are great. Comfortable room and bed, beautiful bathroom - everything we needed for our short stay. Definitely recommended. Room could have been a bit cleaner - but room was still exceptionally clean when compared to the rest of Sri Lankan hotels."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Breakfast buffet is a feast Dark angel cocktails fanatasticInfinity poolAttentive friendly staff From our brief stay nothing could have been better"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Breakfast is amazing and we would highly recommend it to others. Pool is great and staff are brilliant  The location is great overlooking the beach but there is a train track right beside the beach. Also depending on what tourist things you would like to do, it could be some distance to get to"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"I felt very welcomed, which I was worried about being a solo backpacker. It was an excellent and relaxing way to end my 3 month journey. Everything was very clean and inviting. The staff were all very nice and helpful. I am sure it is just how the system works, but it would be nice if the taxes were included to the price of food and beverage. It ended up being quite a bit more than what is stated. Also, I requested to pay for a half day/late check out (which is a great service they offer for late flights), and confirmed it the day before. The next morning I get a call that I need to check out. I let them know that I had paid to check out late and yet they called back a few minutes later questioning me again. I thought THEN it was confirmed, but a few hours later one of the managers came up to my room questioning me and saying that I was suppose to have checked out this morning. I felt that I was being hurried out of the property even though I paid! That really killed the relaxing and inviting vibe for me. . It just seemed at times that they were making sure I would pay for things or that I couldn't be trusted to do so. Other than that I had a great time"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We stayed at Marino Beach Hotel at the beginning of December 2018. This was a fantastic, comfortable and affordable hotel in a very good location. Most of the touristy areas are only a short drive away (depending on traffic of course). The hotel has a good sized roof top pool with views of Colombo. A lot of Colombo is under construction so the view was a lot of cranes and half built buildings. However the pool, steam room and Jacuzzi were very nice. I only went to the gym once, which was small and the treadmill sounded like it may breakdown.  Also when we arrived our 4 rooms were not together despite requesting this at the time of booking. However the staff rectified this very quickly."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Brand new property. Friendly staff. Infinity pool.elaborate breakfast.  Nothing to dislik3
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Fabulous rooftop infinity pool. The room was really comfortable with duvets for the beds, bathtub and rainforest shower. We had a very warm welcome when we arrived and we really enjoyed our stay.  We ended up with an adjoining room and it was quite noisy from the neighbouring guests. Instruction on how to use the AC unit should be in the welcome pack. The welcome pack should have more information in it generally for such a large hotel. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"- Extremely large and comfortable bed.
- Plenty of extras available in the room including night gown, free mini bar, plenty of tea, and slippers to name a few.
- The roof top pool is very big with great views, best roof top pool we’ve been to.
- lovely food, the American breakfast was very nice in the morning.
 - No real atmosphere to sit and spend time in the evenings. The roof top was pretty much empty and that was on New Years! 
- no relax area
- no special party arrangement for the 31st night like other establishments which was a let down."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent all round. Had a wonderful stay.
Great property. Excellent location"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,View from the room was amazing. Restaurant was good. Very tasty food and great staff. They even arranged a table for us without reservation on new year's eve. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great value for money, the rooms were lovely and clean, comfortable bed and has great bathroom facilities. The rooftop pool is the absolute highlight of the hotel with views across the city and sea.
The food buffets are so good, catering to all of your needs, really deliciously well cooked food.
A lovely place to stay in the city. Only faults were that we were given a room directly opposite a construction site after specifically asking if we would be facing it, the receptionist told us no before we paid then we were shown to our room. They were unable to assist with us moving rooms but with the doors to the balcony shut you wouldn’t hear the works too much.
The waiters on the rooftop occasionally forgot your drinks order, so was just a little slow with service."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool is a beautiful place to unwind, the rooms are very clean and comfortable, the service and breakfast buffet both excellent also.  The design could be more modern for such a new hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Nice location on the Marine Drive. It has a shopping mall attached to it which provides good option for shopping and also has a good food court. The infinity pool and the sunset view is great 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,The room is nice. It is not really walking distance for most sightseeing points
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great luxury style accommodation but at a great price, would definitely stay there again! 
There is an attached mall with atm and many shops very convenient. Fantastic pool and gym."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"This place is amazing. Staff incredibly friendly and accommodating. Rooms are beautiful and have lots of little unexpected luxuries such as toothbrushes and shaving kits. 
The rooftop pool is simply fantastic and is an amazing way to watch the sunset. We also had a fabulous display of fireworks for New Years Eve  Perhaps guests could be escorted to a table in the breakfast room. It was so busy we found it difficult to find a seat sometimes, and to find a waiter for tea and coffee.
Also guests leaving beach towels on pool chairs all day while they go off for hours at a time shouldn’t be tolerated. If you’re not back within 30 minutes another guest should be allowed to use the chair  "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything is perfect, clean room, the food is excellent and staff especially A. Sajeevan and Thiwanka are very friendly and helpful, I recommend it for everyone. Nothing "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great location, good food and luxury at moderate price! Language issues with the staff.. a bit noisy inside and the coffee shop needs improvement "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,There was nothing disappointing about this property. Starting from the amazing breakfast spread to the rooms and the kickass view from the roof top with an infinity pool facing the sea. Absolutely loved every moment of my stay here. Its a fancy hotel to suit the luxury during your stay. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Clean, good facilities, friendly staff.  Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel is in a great location, it’s extremely clean and well presented. The rooms are amazing! The mini bar is free, the WiFi is good in most areas and the hotel restaurants/bars offer a lot of selection and are good value for money.  It would be great if there were more sun beds on the deck area by the pool. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Rooms are spacious and nice. Hot tub and shower in the bathroom are clean and very nice.
The infinity pool at the top is the perfect spot to spend time enjoying the sun with a cold drink and relaxing. 
The hotel has an elevator that takes you to a mall, a good perk if you want to do some window shopping. The room we were provided had a bad view to the back of another building despite asking for a room with ocean view. Breakfast is not included and I was charged for making local calls and was told about this extra charge only after the fact. Not the best value for money when you add all the non-included items (breakfast, calls, etc)"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Amazing pool, warm even at 6 pm.
Marino mall attached to the Lobby was great for last minute shopping.
Loads of good food options within short distance, checkout Gallery Cafe!  Staff need to be a little bit more polished with their services."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Nice rooftop pool and good breakfast.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Absolutely everything. Thank you very much. Service was so good, very high quality. Food was amazing. Room absolutely stunning: you can found everything: even make up mirror with light, ironing board and iron. Room was so clean and nice smell of fresh. Restaurant food was really tasty and good quality. Staff was so polite and really helpful 
Rooftop swimming pool was so awesome, really fantastic views  I missed dryer in a room, but I dry my swimming suits on balcony border 
I can’t found stairs for emergency "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The rooftop infinity pool and jacuzzi really, really made our day. Lounging in the pool with that incredible, expansive view of the ocean and the lovely plants all around was an experience to savour. The pool area and shower facilities are exceptionally clean and well-maintained. For us, those are reasons enough to return to the property. But they also had really comfortable beds, and that same ocean view from the Signature King Room (worth forking out the extra $$ for). My tip: ask for room no. 705—it's the corner room on the highest floor, and has additional balcony space to the side. OH, AND THE BREAKFAST SPREAD was incredibly generous and delicious. Definitely pay extra if you have to, and get the breakfast included."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,They have a fabulous pool  It’s not totally central 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Stay was good . And the service was also good.Roof top swimming pool , open air deck is excellent food taste was not so great but they had excellent spread"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,the extra little things and the friendly atmosphere made all the difference nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The infinity pool, the cleanliness and most of all the helpfulness of the staff. Well done!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Smartly designed hotel, lots of attention on details, especially in rooms. Breakfast buffet was one of the best ever: great selection of bread, fresh fruit, western breakfast items, Sri Lankan curries, omelet station, you name it! Rooftop infinity pool and it's surroundings were nice enough for hanging out for a day or two. Sound isolation in the rooms was not perfect. There was also a loud party going on in a nearby room until 5am on one of the nights. Some of the personnel were highly professional, some were clearly not on the same level. Tacky christmas decorations, and christmas tunes playing everywhere."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The infinity pool was worth staying at this hotel. We really appreciated that we had a room around 11.00 as we arrived at the hotel quite early (around 9.00 due to an early arrival to Colombo airport) and in the mean time, we enjoyed a swim at the top floor."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Location  Staff
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Lovely hotel. Excellent rooms which were well equipped with all we needed. The location is ok however you will need a tuk tuk to the main sites. The infinity pool is great. Would definitely stay again!  The taxi service will quote double the going rate.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"everything was perfect,swimming pool,location,restaurant,ocean bar and gril,spa,sea view and marino mall,christmas decorations,playing piano in the lobbyand i want to thank Dilshani in the guest relations she was helpful and nice and we went to kandy with Gayan we enjoyed so much,he was very good. Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Excellent food, service and new clean rooms and facilities. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The bed is great and the shower was really nice.  Good hot water, which can be a real issue in Sri Lanka.  The breakfast was very good with lots of options for any taste.  The pool area is the very best of any hotel I've ever been to.  Absolutely outstanding. The hotel transportation is very expensive and they aren't overly helpful when arranging alternative transportation.  Kind of a, use ours or you're on your own, attitude."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Great buffet breakfast, spacious bedroom (no view though) and the rooftop pool was cool. Walls were paper thin between bedrooms - could hear people talking in room next door!"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Excellent modern rooms, very comfortable bed and a great breakfast buffet. whilst the staff were friendly there only seemed to be a small number who were able to help with any issues etc. also on our first night we were disturbed by the noise from an event on the first floor that was playing loud music. when we rang reception we were told that there was no event on and they were not sure where any noise would be coming from. i went down to the reception to complain (walking past a sign directing people to the event) to be told they would investigate the noise but there was no event on. eventually i spoke to the manager who assured me he would ask for the music to be turned down and apologised. a lot of effort to sort an obvious issue."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"They had an exceptionally good breakfast buffet, with plenty of local Sri Lankan dishes along with all of the usual western fare. Fruit was very fresh and delicious. Large hidden costs in the taxes and fees plus plus. This is not included in the Bookings quotation and was a nasty surprise when we checked in."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Beautiful place, excellent staff, great choice on the menu Not enough sun loungers by the pool"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Swimming PoolHotel is like a little oasis in dirty Colombo. Restaurant on roof top closes early, around 10pm"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Such a divine hotel in a wonderful location with the best pool ever! A brilliant place to relax. The room was fantastic, the bed was extremely comfortable with fabulous pillows, the free mini bar was good, food and drinks were great! The high tea was delicious! Was the perfect last night in Sri Lanka! I hope I can visit again before too long! It took quite a long time to check in and even longer to check out. I also waited quite a long time for a drink in the garden bar once when the waiter forgot but otherwise the service was fantastic. Leaving was incredibly hard! Had to tear myself away!"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Location is great . Amazing breakfast.
Big clean and comfortable rooms .
Great infinity pool . The Chinese restaurant is very average .
It doesn't taste like Chinese food and the service was very slow "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Pool area. Rooftop. Location Concierge service poor..no Sri lankan/city map
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Big and clean rooms. Really good breakfast and the infinity pool was amazing! The checking in to the hotel took forever (not enough staff working at the lobby).
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The pool was superb, staff well trained, and nice comfortable rooms not far from the city centre Prices shown without 20% tax"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The rooftop pool and gardens is what makes this hotel. The rooms are fine and good value for money while being in a good location.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Opposite the water, so clean, restaurant lovely breakfast was brill and pool was amazing  Difficult to walk around the area "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything...truly one of my most favorite hotels in the world
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The Merino Beach hotel was fantastic ,our room was fantastic. We stayed for one night before our flight back home. Our room had a sea view and balcony situated almost at the front of the building. We were not keen at the start on staying in Colombo but were so glad we did. We spent the afternoon relaxing on beds by the infinity pool having a few drinks ,plenty of choice here,looking over the Indian ocean although it was overcast.Obviously we were in a city so looking the other way there was construction going on all around the area but that didn't bother us at all,there was no noise.We spent our evening at the Old dutch hospital where there were musicians playing and we ate at the Ministry of Crab . Back at the hotel we went in the terrace bar having coffee and brandy service was faultless. Everywhere the hotel was decorated for Christmas including a full size sleigh reindeer and Santa in the reception area.Breakfast well I have never seen so much choice in my life it was amazing something for every nationality available . There was seating available inside and out looking over the ocean.The hotel kindly kept our luggage for us and arranged the taxi to the airport for midnight whilst we explored Columbia during the day and evening. There was even a shopping mall at the back of the hotel. nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"We loved the sea facing rooms. The view was fantastic and the facilities in the rooms were excellent, be it the sofa, the large screen TV etc. The staff was polite and helpful. The infinity pool was awesome, my friends loved it totally. Must stay hotel in colombo. they could have provided for a complimentary drop to airport."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The roof top pool was on point. Great gym. Breakfast was spectacular and very large rooms.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The roof pooland garden, the restaurants, the acces to the mall This is an construction area, noise"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Everything else was perfect. Rooftop pool and garden are a perfect place to chill and wind down after the busy city. Rooms are nice and new. 1) There were no really healthy, clean food options at breakfast. Corn flakes, corn flakes, corn flakes, the ""muesli"" was also 90% corn flakes. No organic options, no granola, and sugar in everything (yoghurt in bowl and canned yoghurt was both sugared). They have yet to understand that some people may want to eat clean.
2) There wasn't enough personnel handling the checkout, we had to queue for like 15-20 mins to check out."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything is clean and perfect for me even the stuff  Nothing everything was really perfect  
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing stay, amazing view, amazing food. We had room service for Dinner and Buffet for breakfast and everything was perfect. We enjoyed the big spacious and luxurious rooms. And the staff was very helpful. And the pool on the roof is AMAZING."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything starting from room to pool to other facilities including restaurant Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The Marino Beach is an excellent hotel to start or end your visit to Sri Lanka with. The beds are super comfy,  the bathroom is comfortable and spacious. The rooftop infinity pool is amazing!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very nice hotel with excellent stuff
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"More beach lounges in the pool area on the 10th floor would be great! Loyalty membership to be made available online. I did not have time to fill form and hand in to hotel on my first visit"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Very nice hotel, comfortable and lovley staff. Very nice rooftop with swimming pool and bar/restaurant Ras"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.5 ,The room was lovely very comfy bed and pillows!The room had a partial sea view balcony the wrong side for the sun. Pool was good but crowded due to time of year but settled down after Christmas. I was left for 15 mins in the rooftop restaurant  whilst others were attended to who had come in after me without being asked if I wanted a drink etc. Left and went to Chinese restaurant next door. Tried this restaurant again and service was better
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The hotel was very comfortable, every staff member makes every effort to make your stay comfortable and memorable. All staff, are very friendly and helpful. We arrived at the hotel at 6.45am and they were able to check us into our rooms by 9.30am...this was extremely brilliant customer service. The buffet was excellent every day, waiters always serving with a smile. NA"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,This is perfectly clean and great Hotel when comparing to all Sri Lanka. Absolutely no negative things i can mention. Totally recommend!

One jour and 15 minutes from airport. Perfect after or before long flight. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"beautiful room and hotel. Staff very kind and helpful. Facilities amazing Could not access internet in room. We eat in both restaurants, service very bad waited for ages to get condiments and drinks. Food in Chinese was terrible so much salt was unable to eat it, was not charged. Noticed that service through out Sri Lank very poor. Not sure why as just asked for basic things, Such a shame as such an amazing hotel and country"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It was comfortable new and very close to nearby attractions 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Everything was good! The check in could be a bit swifter.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Exceptionally outstanding hotel in all respect. Everything is brand new and well dsigned and decorated, the staff are mostly young, and highly motivated to do their best in serving the hotel guests. Every thing is outstanding. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amazing rooftop pool. Spacious room. Bed is super comfortable. I like everything 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great new hotel. 
Staff is very helpful, the rooftop pool is amazing and the food at the Chinese restaurant on the top floor is great."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Loved the helpfulness of the staff especially Sumith.  Alot of great people work there..and the location and the hotel layout is wonderful. 
The pool on the top floor is outstanding..Will definately book again "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Extremely good property! Very nice rooms and excellent location. The staff members need a lot of training. I think when you operate a luxury hotel, the customers should not be put in a uncomfortable situation, especially the way you treat them!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,5 star property at 4 star price.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very clean property. Excellent views. Lovely room. Very nice food. Very helpful staff
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This hotel is grate,located in one of the main avenues of Colombo and close to all the attractions. It has it own small shopping center where you can get whatever you need. Staff is very nice and always greeting you with a smile. Their coffee in their little cafe is great which is important for me because I cannot do mornings without coffee. The infinity pool is amazing and perfect to relax and take pictures. I honestly thought this hotel was perfect and the ratio quality/price was amazing. I think that a hotel like this would be 3 times more expensive in the U.S.  My only complaint is that they have a block for the volume of the TV in the room. I wanted to watch a movie late at night and I could barely hear it but the intro video of the Hotel was super loud. I would like to control the volume of the TV myself. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"After a long haul flight, the infinity pool was to die forThe vast array and variety of food on offer at Breakfast was breathtaking.Generous sized room Infuriating and complicated individual air-conditioning/heating controls that none of us could get to work. And neither could two different members of their own staff"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Very nice new place good value for money Regarding cleanliness the attention to detail is sometimes missing e.g. windows and shower glas and tables still had fingerprints
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Beautiful hotel NA
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Lovley hotel, helful and friendly staff. Facilities are amazing and the buffet restaurant is really good!My only negative is that we had lunch at the pool bar and it was very over priced for two sandwiches and I would recommend the hotel to try some sort of mosquito candles as I was eaten alive in the 40mins we were having lunch!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The hotel was beautiful and in a great location. The train station is just a short walk away and if you need a tuk tuk to get around, there are plenty available. I really enjoyed the rooftop pool overlooking the ocean. My favorite part was the breakfast buffet!! Soooooo good! Coffee was good and there was sooooo many good food choices for everyone to choose from. I'm a vegan and was thoroughly full and satisfied every morning! The room was clean and spacious! I was in a smoking room (even though I'm a non-smoker), but there wasn't any lingering smell of old cigarettes or anything like that, which I was grateful for."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Clean clean clean
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Our room and the food were amazing  The staff didn’t really help with our early check in and we waited from 5 am till 10 am. Even though we asked about it months before and we were willing to pay because our flight arrived early.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Staff went above and behind to help us with every need. The infinity pool was even more breathtaking than the photos and we easily spent two days by the pool. Buffets for breakfast and dinner are a must - an absolutely delicious array that left us in food comas. The Marino bottled water was not chemically treated and made my partner a little sick.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Overall we loved our experience at this hotel. The pool was the spot to be but you need to get there early to secure a chair as it fills out quickly and people stay there for the duration of the day. The food was pretty good as there was a wide variety to choose from. The most disappointing part of our stay was that I had informed the hotel of our late arrival and dispite my efforts, our room (king size beach view) was not available so my partner and I were forced to take up a room with twin beds instead for the same price. I was very disappointed that we were constantly being told that our room would be ready by a certain time and that was not the case. After continuously following up the readiness of our room for the duration of the next day we were able to eventually get what we originally booked. However, manager was helpful in doing all he could but this standard of service needs improvement. See review."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Room was fabulous as was the rooftop 50m infinity pool and bar. The gym was the best that I have ever seen and used in a hotel. I didn't eat the food but there was a food court nearby and local cafes. Balconies were not private as you could see all the other balconies on your floor i.e. there were no side partitions. Hotel would be better served with more lifts. More sunbeds are required for the roof top.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Very beautiful and big rooms. 
There is a mall in the ground floor.
The staff is kind and helpful.
The roof top swimming pool is amazing.
The variety of food in the 2nd floor restaurant."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable, good size modern rooms  Service a little slow, more sri lankan food could be offered "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"just over my expectations...fantastic balance between quality and price, balcony for smokers and top service!!!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Position/location, infinity pool, service, breakfast, it was perfect. Thanks for cake for anniversary! Situation with door beeping, when they are closed, it is not enough, it need to be duble check."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"the hotel is beautiful and very clean. the staff were extremely nice and helpful. the canteen and international dinner buffet were superb (even for a vegetarian/ vegan diners). if i was very picky i'd say add more veggie options to the menu, but this is only because i have nothing bad to say about the hotel and staff."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Super comfy bed in a spacious well equipped room. The bathroom was great. Both Check in and Check out took over 15 minutes and there were long queues with only a few staff working behind the desk, but there were still plenty of staff stood around doing nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Awesome place .. the pool n the ocean view is the best u can get to see 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Nice location ,beach,mall ,casino ,spa all in walking g distance "

marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"People were the main ingredient. Everybody was friendly. Service in the roof bar was a little slow"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Rooftop infinity pool and towel service

Spotless rooms with daily cleaning
Huge comfortable bed with four pillows
Ocean view with a big city vibe
Airport shuttle service
Awesome staff, were really helpful. Always service with a smile."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Facilities, the buffet, the food, the value, the gym is the best! Check out experience is the worst ive ever experienced. You should not have to wait 45 minutes to settle your bill.. especially after you are told by the hotel that everything is ""cashless"".Also rated as a 5 star but its more like a 4 or 4.5 star."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great place. Infinity pool is amazing and let us check in at 9am! Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Clean and spacious rooms. Lovely roof top pool. Rich breakfast. A great place to stay at to relax after your flight and before leaving to see the rest of Sri Lanka. Very slow check-in. About a half an hour wait after a 20 hours flight.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Rooms very clean. The food is amazing and the infinity pool !! Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything was great.
Staff were kind and helpful.
I really liked food there, too.
I strongly recommend this hotel for people who will go on a vacation. Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Fantastic staff, always willing to please. Special mention - Razmie at reception exceeded expectations with his professionalism. Restaurant staff was fantastic too and the range and quality of all meals was excellent. Expensive taxi ride to Kandy provided by the hotel and driver was unprofessional. The location of the hotel is away from markets, attractions and other hotels in the city, but a quick bus or tuk tuk ride will get you around with ease."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel is amazing, 100% recommended. The rooms are well renovated, the bathrooms are very clean, the rooftop pool is AMAZING with a beautiful view, and the staff are super nice. Thank you for a pleasant stay, we absolutely loved it.  Minor problems. The walls were thin so we could hear everything the neighbors were saying, so that was a bit annoying. But the rooms are super comfortable so we weren’t really bothered. Also, I would recommend the property to increase their number of sunbeds in the rooftop pool. Other than that there were no complaints. Absolutely beautiful. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Rooftop area 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great service. bed and food!
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Comfortable and spacious room. Amazing sunset. It was the best decision to end our Sri Lanka journey in here.  Additional payment for breakfast even with such a high price for the room. A bit noisy due to balconies are just side by side. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Food were so good and the location room is amazing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Checking in and checking out takes lots of time. We were made to wait in a que a bit longer for both checking in and out
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Excellent view!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing staff, very clean room, perfect breakfast and the most incredible rooftop and pool that I ever see !!! I highly recommend.  Nothing, all is perfect. I highly recommend !"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amaizing endless roof top swiming pool. Nice food in grill restaurant. Great rooms.  Waiters in grill restaurant needs better supervision. Sometimes they can't see guest. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Excellent hotel, only marred by the fact that there is an Address Hotel being built next door and they worked until very late. The noise wasn't terrible but it was annoying. The hotel itself is very good. Breakfast was better than expected, and on both nights I ordered room service, and both times the food was delivered quickly and was very good quality. Construction noise from the site next door. Fiddly AC settings, but that's no big issue."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The beds were comfy, great shower pressure, clean bathroom and great breakfast! The AC in upper level was good but AC in lower level was not working properly"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Happy about the general cleanliness, food and the service. Rude front desk staff,doesn't greet or smile.Took nearly an hour to check-in and offered rooms with a worst view despite contacting the hotel few months before the visit.I had to spent an hour arguing with the duty manager (Julian)to convince and get a room change with an average view.
First impressions of the hotel made me thoroughly disappointing.I recommend hotel front desk staff further training on customer care and to be polite.
Food standards were amazing and we personally commended the Ex.Chef.Restaurant staff and their service standards are beyond par."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,It had everything in a good location with helpful and friendly staff
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Lovely haven in a hectic city.
The infinity pool.  Breakfast cooks were rude. Took an age to make a pancake and didn’t even get one after 30mins. Had to leave.
Fruit selection was poor considering the country we were in."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Breakfast spread and ambience Bedspreads were not very clean . Everything else was good
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Good size room. Nice bathroom. Lovely pool. The breakfast buffet not included in room price. Good selection but some of it was cold sadly.
Extra bed for my daughter was a bit like a camp bed and a bit lumpy compared to the lovely bed we had."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Beautiful and well maintained property, everything from the check in to the check out was well managed and the kids also loved it.  The infinity pool was beautiful and the view was awesome.  Staff was very helpful and courteous and rooms very spacious.  The food was awesome, especially the huge spread of breakfast had great variety of food to offer.  We enjoyed every bit of stay at Marino Beach hotel.  We would definitely want to come back and stay at Marino Beach hotel again."

 Waiting 25 mins to check in at an off peak time.
Borg Jacuzzis wasnt in use under maintenance and replaced a rather small spa which wasn't safe to get into very slippery ."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Super luxury & very clean I couldnt fault the hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,We celebrate Christmas with a lovely buffet. Very friendly staff. Nice rooftop swimming pool and bar. We rented Tuktuk's who took us to the highlights of Colombo. Not enough sun beds around the swimming pool.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Service and the food at the restaurant was excellentThe bathrooms were kept clean"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The swimming pool on the roof is amazing!The breakfast is really an experienceThe staff is really kind and nice It's difficult to say...The only little issue that we had was about the lift, only 3 lifts in the morning when everybody is running for food are really not enough"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Check-in queue
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The rooftop pool and garden area are fabulous! The rooms are also divine and the area has a bit more of a local feel than Galle Face, which is nice! Could do with a few more sun lounges near the pool on the deck."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Super luxurious Photos made it look like you're on the beach... but you're actually on a busy road next to a beach. That road and also train-line are very noisey.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Picturesque roof top infinity pool and bar /eating area near the pool plus breakfast area over looking the ocean Very large characterless reception area 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The property is brand new and the room are very well equipped. The breakfast buffet is incredible. The pool on the 8th floor is packed but perfect for watching the sunset  I believe the smoothness/efficiency of the check-in process could be improved.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Staff very helpful food excellent great place would stay here next time I'm in Colombo thanks to all staff
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Breakfast, lunch and Dinner - perfect mix and plenty of everythingVery friendly staffBig nice roomsShopping mall inside - even if small The jacuzzis did not work, had no waterToo few sun-beds by the pool and no ""don't just leave your towel there"" policyLocation"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Excellent place to spend the last day of holidays before going to the airport. The rooftop pool is really amazing. Good value for money!  All good
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,The roof pool Service at the pool bar
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The restaurant and bar staff were excellent. The pool, restaurants and cleanliness of the room were up to western standards but not the best I have seen in Sri Lanka. The mall attached to the hotel was also good value. We were finishing off our honeymoon in Marino beach so we splashed out on a suite. We asked the hotel ahead of time if they could arrange something for us as we had done with the other 5 hotels we used in Sri Lanka. Nothing was prepared when we arrived in the room. Also when we checked in, I had to go back downstairs as the check in person never asked if I wanted to preauthorise expenses so I could use the bars and restaurants. This took an additional wait of 19 minutes to sort out. No apology from the same staff member. Later that afternoon in the rooftop bar, when paying against the room, they had not acknowledged the payment which took another 15 minutes for them to sort out. To add insult to injury, my wife is pregnant and she could not enter half of our suite due to and overpowering smell of cigarette smoke. This was reported repeatedly and the hotels solition was to come up and spray air freshener which masked the smell for an hour at a time. I would not recommend this hotel as the management staff are useless."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Everything  There is no beach in front of the hotel?
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool and jacuzziBreakfast was excellentShower and amenities"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"It is near to everything, it was comfortable and clean. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"1. Service from Ashni in reception.  Solved our room issues efficiently.
2. Service from Thiwanka in the restaurant.
3. Buffet dinner in Tides restaurant. Good food, great choice. 1. Nearly impossible to get a fresh hot cup of tea at breakfast despite asking several times. Worst tea after nearly 8 weeks in Sri Lanka. Most days was cold, over brewed,  and undrinkable.
2. People dumping towels, books, hats, etc on the pool beds then leaving for hours before using on their return.  Selfish. Rude. Inconsiderate.  Need to have a time limit like many hotels and cruises.  Maximum 30 minutes then you're items are removed by staff until you return. This indicates that more sun beds are needed. 
3. Locked exits from stairs/fire escape. Not sure if this strategy meets local government fire regulations? Not allowed to use the stairs. Why? I think the only hotel in the world we have stayed at where you can't use the stairs????
4. Verandah was dirty. Would guess that it hadn't been cleaned for quite a while."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Rooftop and swimming pool
 Climatisation, too cold!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Nice and modern Hotel. Very good interior and clean. Good Location. The staff at the reception is toooo slow! Its not normal that i need for check in and for check out 2x 30 minutes!!There was not much People traffic. The staff at the reception must learn to work professional and  faster..."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Right by the beach and in a central location in Colombo. The hotel was very comfortable to stay in and the rooftop pool was very nice. A bit too commercial especially at breakfast with lots of tourists around
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I recomend all of others, friendly staff, comfetable rooms, wonderful fool with beautiful location."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"I was fully satisfied with the buffet, the chilli crabs that I ordered was delicious, well constructed balance of spiciness.Excellent customer service from the friendly staff of food and beverage team (Manoj/Tilan/madu/Triwanha/Mahesh/Janith).Big thank you to Chef Sanjaya and Gamage. Special thanks goes to Ramsheed the duty manager, Sumith the concierge manager and Faizal the Food and beverage manager for your kind and generous hospitality, impeccable service which was above and beyond the call of duty. You guys rock. Keep up the good work.Would happily stay there again, definitely coming back and absolutely amazing hotel. I think the lobby staff and travel desk staff were not that friendly, lacking customer service."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"All new clean modern rooms. Up to date technology. Bathroom stunning. All glass with screening for privacy. 
Breakfast on outside terrace looking over ocean.  Infinity pool on roof amazing with bar.  Nothing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It was fantastic. The facilities are exception and the service as well. The rooftop pool and garden are fantastic. We felt it was a phenomenal value compared to a lot of other hotels we looked at in the area. It’s also new so everything is very clean and in good shape. Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The rooftop pool is really amazing and is great at sunset for a swim and a drink I liked everything
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Service quality and service culture of the staff
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything from food to entertainment Extended lunch and dinner timming
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Property Location, Room Size, Staff, Cleanliness. We checked in late in the night about 1am and we were informed that the standard check-out time is 12noon. So we spoke the guy at the reception about a slight extension of our check-out time as it was our last night in Sri Lanka and we were exhausted after a week long travel. So, the guy said he wont be able to do it but it can be extended if we call at the reception around 9am and let them know. So, we called in the morning to seek an extension which was immediately denied. This was disappointing."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Infinity swimming pool is the best part of Marino. Rooms are big with all modern facilities service and amenities. Location is on prime spot of city in the vicinity of beach. Beach is not wide here - you cant have bath/swim in the beach.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Pool
 Na
"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Absolutely the best hotel to stay in Colombo. The staff are kind and attentive. The mini fridge drinks and nicknacks are free. Room is amazing with a spacious bathroom with a tub. You can even watch tv from the tub with a drink in your hand (the tv comes out from the wall to assist the angle and speakers inside the washroom ceiling). Breakfast options are great. Room service is quick and reasonably priced. Check in and check out takes a tad long
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Beautiful rooftop area and pool! Really nice vibe and the room was spacious. Breakfast wasn’t included but it was super nice.  Could have more places to sit/lounge on the grassy area of the rooftop, there’s not really enough sun loungers."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Rooftop pool was amazing. We spent a lot of time by the pool. Breakfast buffet had lots of options and was very nice. Really good gym. Big rooms with nice bathrooms.  Overall was good. Location wasn’t amongst the other hotels. But still close. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It's exactly what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. The facilities are brand new and spotless. Staff is very kind and helpful. You've got access to numerous restaurants, the infinity pool, gym, spa etc etc. It's fantastic value for money, if you're staying in Colombo and looking for somewhere nice to stay, it's a no-brainer. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Great location and services. Staff are friendly and the rooms are spacious and clean.  The wifi is hopeless. Very poor signal even in the rooms 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The modern hotel has excellent facilities. The rooftop pool offers great views of Colombo and the Indian Ocean. The hotel's gym/fitness centre was first class. We all enjoyed the variety offered at the buffet breakfast in the morning. Our room was clean, spacious and full of mod cons."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"every thing,the room bathroom,balcony,staff.food all the roof garden chinese restaurant. nil"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Great new hotel, new roomes with amazing roof top pool area and gym. Seems to be the best option in town. Furthermore, both the buffet breakfast and dinner are great - on par or better with each western 5 start hotel. Staff is really not great. Checkin was slow and with mistakes, food/drinks orders extremly slow (once I finished dinner before the glas of vine arrived) and overall, they are not very well trained. Sad, because the hotel is great otherwise."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The facilities were great, the best is the swimming pool on the rooftop  For a 5 star hotel they have very bad service. First of all when you do the check in they don’t explain anything to you they just hand you the key room. The service at the rooftop bar is pretty bad, there is wine menu with a good selection of wines but they don’t have anything available, of the list they only had 2 white wines available. To order a drink you have to always go to the bar because the servers ignore you. We had lunch there and we asked more than three times to bring us something that never came to the table. The facilities are as a 5 star hotel the service is way far from that you can have better service in a 3 star hotel in Europe. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Clean, staff friendly, nice big room with balcony, rooftop pool excellent  Nothing specific "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great place to stay, amazing service. We ordered room service 10mins before they finished serving the dinner menu as we just came back from a long day’s trip. They were very kind and proceeded to serve us a delicious meal which made our night. Great room, great price and you must go up to the rooftop - pool is amazing with incredible view!!! 5/5 thank you!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The swimming pool was lovely. The views of Colombo from the tenth floor were impressive.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Stunning roof top garden and pool. Central location and good service. Possibly a shower in the pool area and handrails to enter the pool.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Love the rooftop!!!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It exceeded my expectation … every thing was perfect … Breakfast and dinner was awesome … staff were friendly helpful and very accommodating ...I would defiantly stay again ...rgds
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Roof top pool is amazing but need to get there very early to get a bed. Rooms are spacious and comfortable.Buffett dinner at the hotel was very good, lots of choice and all good quality. Breakfast also had lots of choice. Would recommend for a one stop before / after airport as there isn’t much to do in Colombo itself."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Great rooftop swimming pool, great sea views and breakfast. Totally worth it!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Really good and safe  Nothing much 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,the food was excellent we loved it. Nothing as it was so good
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Rooms were great, facilities wonderful, pool area brilliant. Breakfast was good too. Food  just ok in ocean bar and grill. Slow service. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We loved this hotel. We flew from London to Colombo which is a very long flight. We stayed in this moderately priced hotel and this was the best decision ever. Despite the price, the hotel felt like a 5 star. Super clean and modern and luxurious! Felt very happy when I got my room. We then explored up and the roof terrace pool and the garden are just beautiful. Paradise on the terrace for sure. The pool was massive and perfect temperature. They even had a hot tub! The gym although i didn’t get to use was also big and modern.  This is not about the hotel but Colombo as a city is fairly stressful. We ventured out and really regretted it. After a long flight, I would suggest you just enjoy what the hotel has to offer and sleep well before you go off to other exciting places! 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Brand new high quality hotel with all facilities.Incredible roof top swimming pool.Impressive breakfast with a wide choice and high quality food.Very large and confortable beds.Very friendly staff (in every role). Check-in and check out procedures could be improved because both are too long for pre-booked rooms.Air-con in the restaurant is definitely too cold."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Ideal location to the 2 rocks  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The pool is wonderful for the day and to watch the sunset.Fantastic buffet. Martini cocktails weren’t great and the pool bar service is slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Fabulous rooms great pool and Spa. The fact that the staff made a big deal of allowing 2 extra hours for a late checkout although we found out that the hotel was not at even 95% occupancy.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Breakfast buffet Skin allergy after using in house cosmetics samples in the shower

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"All staff very nice. Good buffet Service a little bit slow. Seems to be a symptom of Sri Lanka."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,I liked the place as always  The view was not that good 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Liked the property 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The spacious rooms and locations Just 3 elevators and due to that long walks to the room
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Beatiful food and environment pool
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Awesome location amazing room great service great staff .. The buffet menu could be better .. specially for vegetarians.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The hotel is great and it's location is really amazing facing the ocean.
I liked the rooftop pool and all the surroundings ""bar, garden, etc."" where you got to see a beautiful skyline of Colombo.
The staff were very nice and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was not that good."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This hotel best for location,stuff and hospitality. Very nice hotel and interior was too good. Like it soo much.."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The piano player in the lobby There was an unpleasant smell in the bathroom
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Clean and Location is fantastic.You can enjoy club in the same building and it was quite nice. Waiting for check-in is quite bad. (too long, some sri lanka guest try to cut in line)But this is common in Sri Lanka.So people who visit Sri Lanka should used to this situation."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was perfect!  The one thing that was a bit annoying was that booking said one price when we booked and when we got to the hotel we had to pay a bigger amount. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Lovely clean and spacious rooms, even with a little complementary mini bar.
Room had a gorgeous king size bed which slept like a dream, hotel only opened June / July 2018 so still a very new space. 
Nice couch , gorgeous decor as well as a desk in your bedroom.
The bathroom was very modern and came with high quality amenities like shampoo and body wash (that smelled heavenly)
Even though the hotel is very large, we experienced no noise.
The hotel was beautifully decorated as we visited around Christmas which was definitely a nice touch.
Lastly but not at all least was the awesome pool on the top floor...the views!!! You won't be disappointed.
Extra note, this is by far the most high tech gym we came across in Sri Lanka. The hotel also had a small mall on the ground floor with a few gift shops and even a food court.  Not much we didn't like. Only thing, but this was not a big thing and didn't really impact our stay - The hotel sometimes couldn't help with foreign exchange as they didn't always have money available. This however was such a small thing."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Lovely hotel, clean, fabulous pool & the spa treatments were amazing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The hotel and amazing Beds a little hard. And could do with more international channels on tv.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The room was excellent, the swimming pool fantastic. The breakfasts set us up for the day."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"It was a beautiful hotel, the room is was stunning as was the rooftop pool.  The staff called 30 minutes before check out to remind us that we needed to check out which then made us feel rushed. We then stood in the check out queue for 45 minutes which I thought was unacceptable.  I paid for the hotel in full on departure and then they went on to hold an additional £140 for 10 days after we had checked out. This was more than the total room cost that we had already paid. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The best what we’ve seen in not-interesting-for-tourists Colombo (and “Ministry of crab”, #25 in the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants). Chilling near the the pool on the top is the best idea. Some cocktail in the lobby bar with a piano classic music also nice. And breakfast is awesome! P.S. recommend to book the room higher superior category: glass bathroom would be an extra joy."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Staff was so nice. The place is beautiful. We loved the infinity pool. There’s no access to beach right from the hotel. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The food! it was amazing and the staff very kind :)
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Outstanding service and value for money. The hotel has everything you need and more without even the need to leave! The restaurant food, drinks and club are all exceptional. I would stay here every time when visiting Colombo from here on in. More information on facilities and access etc could be provided upon check-in."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Very comfortable clean rooms. Stunning roof top pool. Good gym. Friendly staff 1. Food - breakfast and dinner are served as a buffet which seemed comparatively expensive. The food was fine but not excellent 2. Overuse of single use plastic - endless plastic water bottles, straws and we noticed plastic knife/fork statues in the dining room. Think of the environment please"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Beautiful location, extremely clean, ans staff were super friendly, helpful and welcoming. Would definitely recommend."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Service was excellent rooms very clean and spacious and the pool was very nice 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Perfect view from the roof. Nice garden and perfect place for a swim or to relax and watch the ocean.  It would be good if there were more places to sun bath by the pool. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Lovely light and airy bedrooms, excellent bathroom facilities.  Food in dining area and poolside bar was very good.  Roof top Infinity pool and garden area is fantastic. Disappointed that the hotel is not actually located on the beach.  You have to cross a busy road and railway line and there is not much of a beach to use for actual sunbathing or swimming."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Everything was great, especially breakfast variety. All facilities in one place, even shopping mall, ATM and VR entertainment. Great presentation of the hotel was ruined by tasteless Christmas decorations"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Sorry i don't have much information as i was in the hotel less than 8 hours but i can say the hotel was magnificent and i will definitely be back and for a much longer stay. A longer stay
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The room we had was fabulous, with a side sea view balcony. The bathroom was great and the shower a welcome highlight after Colombo at rush hour! The breakfast buffet is also a triumph and you can’t fault the welcome and efficiency of the staff. I can’t really think of anything particularly negative. We only stopped for a night on our way through so I don’t really know how convenient the hotel is location wise but if I am ever back in Colombo I would stay there again.  "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"High-class stay for moderate price, with everything I could hope for in a five star hotel! Room was spacious, bed extremely comfortable, modern bathroom with a bathtub, a balcony with partial seaview and complimentary minibar (although only soft drinks). Room service for food and drinks was easy and fast with good selection and surprisingly tasty food, with decent pricing. Hotel facilities absolutely top notch, a gym, mindblowing infinity pool with seaview, jacuzzi and restaurant/bar on the roof. Shopping mall just next door. Airport transfer for a decent fee available as well. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The infinity pool is just amazing ! We were also pleasantly surprised by a Mall inside the hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Friendly staff, great rooftop pool, excellent location to discover Colombo, superb breakfast buffet Water for the bath was not very warm"

So many restaurants, an infinity swimming pool, a huge gym and incredible views!
Our room was enormous for the money we paid and the amenities were amazing.
We had both in room and in restaurant dining which were both very tasty. 
The hotel was connected to a mall so everything was in reach, a short walk to the city centre also. 
Would definitely recommend!"

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Great hotel the staff were amazing the pool is fab! We got good food in the restaurant and there was entertainment where we ate which was good! Overall great stay! The only negative was there was tax of 30% added for the room which booking.com do not mention!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Best hotel we have ever stayed in! The place was amazing!!!!! Rooms are very spacious and the bathroom was exceptional! Connected to the Marino mall made it easy to browse the shops and close enough to bars and restaurants! Would have stayed a lot longer if we weren’t leaving for the next city!  The only thing was the reception staff looked a bit overwhelmed as we waited a good 30 minutes or more to check out. Other than that it was a perfect stay! 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Restaurant and sea view  Staff did not help to find transport to move around colombo
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,We loved everything in Marino beach hotel. Thank you everyone for making it much better
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I loved how everyone was so polite and genuinely helpful. Rooms were clean and always had a lovely smell. I would definitely go there again 😊
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The beautiful roof top infinity poolGreat gymGreat restaurants The lovely, attentive staff The building works nearby- but that’s completely out of the hotels control"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Fantastic Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Location is excellent. Swimming pool is very clean and staffs are so kind and helpful.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The poolside and garden restaurant are beautiful.  Rooms are well appointed. The mattress and pillows are extremely uncomfortable.  The mattress just sinks in and the pillow is so high that I barely slept on both the nights I was there.  And the housekeeping is extremely slow to respond to any requests. There is a restaurant and bar attached on the verandah...both are extremely poor in aesthetics, which is a shame because the rest of the hotel is done so well."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The location, overall cleanliness, the Breakfast spread out was oursome also the seating area for breakfast was excellent.  We reached early in the morning 6.30am.
Asked for early check in,was told that houskeeping staff starts work by 8.30am so we said once they start working and make room ready can give us but don't know what was the policy for giving out room as we saw many guest checkout form morning we got room after 2.00pm and it was very tiring to wait such a long time after a late night flight. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The best part is the top floor swimming pool providing a very good view also.Food in chinese restaurant on top floor was also very good.Room quite clean and very modern fittings and facilities.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Absolutely everything! Nothing!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Staff are approachable at all times. Good atmosphere as the hotel is attached to a shopping complex that one can visit & unwind. The staff at the travel/taxi desk are very helpful as well in guiding tourist & making sure their needs are answered. The buffet breakfast is very elaborate & one can find whatever they would like to eat. The views of the sea from the dining area are super cool, with local trains passing by creating a good feeling... Rooms are big & comfortable with all amnesties... Best of all is the infinity swimming pool on the top floor overlooking the sea & city views  & a garden area for kids to run around or just soak in the sun. All was good."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel rooms were immaculately decorated, and quality far exceeded our expectations and the cost. The room came with a bath, shower, balcony over looking the city and sea, large bed and sofa area. The staff were incredibly helpful, and brought drinks to greet you as you arrive. Large infinity pool, with waiters on hand for drinks and quality food a few steps away. Large breakfast buffet with many vegetarian and halal options. Again, worth emphasising is the attentiveness of the staff - they were very eager to help our every need. We’re booking in for another night at the end of our stay! "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Loved the pool as always! This is the second time we visited within 8 months. The room service food was affordable. The morning buffet was good, more options this time and staff at the resturant was friendly.  Check in took soo long. There wasn’t anywhere to sit and no proper welcome. It took a good 20 minutes to check us in. Also check out was worse. Two receptionists was chatting with a foreign guest more like flirting even after his check out was done and we were just standing there and waiting. The guy at the reception next to them was fast and managed to check out 3 guests including us while the other ladies where completely ignoring the fact that we were waiting to check out. We dint like the view this time. The previous room we received in our first stay had a better room. Although same category the view was just buildings and a partial beach vurw. Not sure if we will be back. "

Staff is very nice and friendly. Reception very efficient. Travel desk very helpful. Hotel taxi is very good, Mahesh is an excellent driver, very necessary in Colombo traffic."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Tea was out of this world.The staff is so helpful and obliging. Bit disappointed with the cleaners had to ask them to come and clean the room as they were bit slow twice. But cleanliness was excellent. I would stay there again if I went back to Colombo. I can understand why they don’t believe in waisting food but curries left over from night before for breakfast looked bit unappetising.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The rooms were clean and lovely with comfy beds which was exactly what we needed after weeks travelling . It would have been good to have had a more thorough check in about what was available at what times and where things were around the building . We sometimes
Got confusing information from different members of staff. A later breakfast would have been much appreciated too!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Its a very new hotel and its sparkling clean. 
We requested for late check out and they were very kind to extend 2 hours which was perfect for our flight time.
Breakfast is awesome  Still can improve check in procedure. In  a class property like this and guest had to stand in a queue looks little awkward."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very nice and clean rooms, delicious breakfast and amazing infinity pool. Had a 2-night stay in Colombo and left the hotel only for dinner as the poolside was so nice. Very convenient and cheap car service by the hotel if you want to go to somewhere in the city or need a drop off to the airport."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"We left a beach dress there, communicated with the hotel and no reply.  Sad really because the staff were great. There is no beach, there is a railway track in front of the hotel. the pool is amazing, the sunset bar was great and we loved it here, the rooms were very clean."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This hotel is AMAZING!!!!!! The rooftop infinity pool, garden bar and adjacent rooftop restaurants are absolutely stunning. The food that is served is excellent (including room service) and very reasonably priced. Drink prices are also priced well to the point where we ate and drank almost exclusively at the hotel at the end of our stay in Sri Lanka. Lakshita in the Garden Bar was excellent! The rooms are beautifully appointed, air con works exceptionally well and the beds are very comfy. After 6 days of guesthouses with low pressure showers, the rain shower head was a welcome relief. Check in and check out is a slightly longer than usual process but aside from this tiny issue, there is nothing else at all that I can comment negatively on."

I like the sunset bar and their staff. Funny and customer service oriented.
Breakfast was very good.  The reception staff is lame. Especially when I asked for 1 hout late check out the guy on phone was lame.
The lighting in the terrace bar is very dim
I got food poisoning in the mall (not the hotel)

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Beautiful room with very comfy bed.  The pool is amazing. Buffet dinner and breakfast was amazing.  We had to leave early for our flight and they wouldn’t let us take anything from the breakfast buffet to eat on the way which was a bit mean when we had paid for it.  
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Very comfortable bed. The rooftop pool is great and has an amazing view! The staff was friendly and very helpful when it came to exploring the city and booking transportation.  They didn’t tell us when we checked in that you needed to reserve the seats right next to the infinity pool. We got to the pool when it opened and the staff was very rude about us sitting in those seats. The seats were empty for about 4 hours. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Beautiful hotel, very well equipped with everything you could need. Staff were amazingly helpful and polite"

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Best value luxury hotel in Colombo. Everything is amazing from the buffet breakfast to the rooms and massive rooftop pool. Limited lounge beds around the pool.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Good location for city and outside city as well  I wish it had a beach 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Great location to relax. The layout of the hotel is great with a shopping mall on the next level. Restaurants in the mall was good. Fabulous view from the pool. The price could have been made a bit more competitive to make it more affordable to guests with average income. Restaurant / Room service needs to be 24 hours, we were not able to place an order as it was past midnight and orders were not taken."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"My first impression was not that good when I was offered the worts fruit juice ever. In a country with so many natural juices, the juice was not natural and tasted really bad... I have stayed in back pack hotels during my trip and even in those medium priced places I was offered fresh coconut water or a natural juice. Besides this, everything else was nice. The pools is absolutely amazing, the breakfast is a feast for the eyes and the stomach, the location is also nice (15 minutes by tuk tuk from the fort area) and I ate at the pool bar and the chinese restaurants and both places were good and affordable. I will never forget the roof top swimming pool and the wonderful smell of the bath towels! Only the horrible welcome juice made a bad impression. Try offering a fresh coconut or a mango or pineapple juice. It will make a big difference."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing pool, really friendly staff, breakfast had a huge range of food and had its own mall attached to it!!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Best Hotel in colombo ,, very nice view non"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Thought it was a great place to stay after an overnight flight. Roof top pool and rooms were fantastic. Great value for money for the room and to spend the day relaxing at the hotel  Breakfast was overpriced if you want a normal sized meal. Cheaper to go to the mall to grab something
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff are very friendly and welcoming, great customer service and always with a smile.  Loved the quality of the hotel and services. The pool and garden area are wonderful. The glass in the bathroom  through the bedroom doesn't provide any privacy.  Some other suggestions would be to not offer plastic straws in drinks and have more water filling stations around the hotel  - every little bit helps protect the environment of Sri Lanka! There are limited sun lunges by the pool - perhaps add some more in the garden area and also as other hotels do place a time limit  - for example if the sun lounge is left unattended for more than 1 hour it is free to another guest to use."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Great pool area Not great service in restaurant
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Infinity pool Can’t thing of anything!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This was a lovely place to spend our final few days in Sri Lanka. Our room was huge (premier king room), and had a lovely view from the balcony. The pool was amazing, we’d suggest going up early if you want a lounger in the water. We ate at the Garden Bar and the Chinese restaurant which were both delicious. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Location is good and recommend using their airport shuttle, very good price and nice service.  We had an adjoining door in our room and unfortunately had very noisy neighbours late at night. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Absolutely amazing place to stay lovely hotel and loads todo will be staying again. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Everything  It was all excellent it would be even better if more stuff outside had just a little bit more English that is the only thing that would make things just a bit easier. 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The top garden, the infinite pool, the view point are wonderful. Really relaxing to have a sit by the pool. No"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It not only met my expectations itself, but also exceeded my expectations of the other hotels from now"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,great hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Clean comfortable rooms. Attentive and pleasant staff. Tasty and expansive breakfast buffet. The star is the rooftop infinity pool, which is a spectacular space. The nearby gym is well equipped.  The bathroom is a little strange- toilet is enclosed in a glass door space which is difficult to navigate in the dark. However the shower has copious amounts of hot water."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Property is superb. Awesome location and view. Breakfast spread is very good. In room dining options are good, food is tasty.
Best part is the swimming pool on top floor .. out of the world!! Internet connection is big time issue. They have free internet, but is NOT good. They can have paid but good connection.
Staff is also slow, I reported a problem with room electric connection, but staff didn't come to attend for 40mins."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The garden pool rooftop !! Amazing views of city and sea  Wasn’t there long enough to have any dislikes 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Staff patience with our request & a surprise cake for my birthday ! The pool & perfect central location !  Busy lift lobby in front of our room woke me up at 1pm. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The room and hotel had it all! A few extra pool side chairs would be great.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very good
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff were all pleasant. My room was on the 7th floor and I had a stunning view from my balcony, overlooking the ocean. The food from their restaurant was quite good.  When the train passes it’s a bit noisy but I still enjoyed my stay. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The design of the hotel speaks for itself with an astonishing infinity pool on the roof. Comfy rooms, professional staff and excellent food for a reasonable price. I don't think one can find a better deal in Colombo."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The rooftop pool is amazing and also the sunset bar. The breakfast buffet is also very good. Don't forget to add 32% to all the prices on the menu. This is service charge and tax.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Swimming pool  Staff attitude needs to improve for a 5star Hotel 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Very clean and well maintained. Super comfortable bed, just what I needed after a long day of travel.  Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,the breakfast menu - the hotel room nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"- amazing rooftop pool
- friendly staff
- late checkout possible
- you can leave your luggage there after your checkout
- you can use the rooftop after check out - far away from the city"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very Clean, comfortable beds, great pool area with lockers and showers, lovely staff Could do with a few more sunbeds but there is plenty of space to put a towel down on the grass area "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This is an amazing hotel, would definitely recommend it, food staff service rooms pool all amazing "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Being a new property, it is very well equipped and maintained. Their pool and gym on the top floor is amazing. Food is reasonably good.  Staff was a bit of a disappointment. I had booked   for 4 nights and wanted to extend stay by a day, and I requested if I could stay in the same room, and will pay the necessary charge. But it took few attempts to make them understand this request and get a result. Also,I had to keep my medicine in the freezer (mini fridge in the rooms did not have), but they flatly refused and said they are not allowed to keep anything from the guest in the kitchen. That was a bit absurd, and it was a small bottle of eye drop and ice pack after all!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff, swimming pool and gym Can't think of anything"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Very nice swimming pool!! Not much to do in the area, but nice for relaxing. Don’t come here and expect a sri lankan experience ;) Maybe it was jut too much luxury for us;) but nonetheless great hotel for the rate"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"We encountered a problem which the management took seriously and dealt with very professionally.The evening buffet dinner in Tides restaurant had a fantastic choice of good tasty freshly prepared food.The roof top gardens and pool provided a lovely are to relax. The check in procedure seemed disjointed and when we did get to our room there was a problem, but it was resolved straight away."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The hotel belongs to a big Sri Lankan company called Damro. The hotel is very nice, the rooms are very modern. We had a big comfortable bed, and the fact that we had a bathtub was even better! We had a really great stay. On the roof they have a big infinite-pool and a viewing deck. The hotel is perfectly located to watch unforgetable sunsets in Colombo! Next to the hotel you fill find the Marino Mall, that doesn't really have much variety but you could still find something to eat less pricey than at the hotel. It is also near the Ceylon Tea Board shop, which I recommend to visit in order to buy Ceylon Tea at the original price (plus they have all available Sri Lankan tea marks!). There are not enough chairs and lounges in the pool area, and the few places to sit are not in the shadow."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The infinity pool is incredible.  Great way to spend an afternoon if you are tired of touring or waiting for a plane.  The staff are smiling and helpful and allowed us access to the pool and showers after we checked out.  Rooms are spacious with balconies and complimentary mini bar! Restaurants tend to be a little expensive!
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Weather Food
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It’s an amazing place. Everybody is taking care of you. The room looks really impresive, the swimming pool is much more beautiful then I expected. 
If you want to eat, they have really good food in the restaurant with big portions. Also we paid for the buffet in the evening and it totally worth it. 
 I was really satisfied by the experience there. I would  recommend you to try it. In a Srilanka that is quoted expensive in terms of tourism, this place is a great deal ❤️"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Swimming pool and rooftop garden  Could not order a la carte. Said it would be approximately 1 1/2 wait. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"5-star accommodations in terms of comfort and hospitality. No one told me about the SECRET PASSAGE through the ""Auto Mall"".  Spent 4 days walking around the outside of the hotel, getting harassed on both sides by tuk-tuk drivers that scam you into visiting gem shops.  I didn't find the secret entrance (it's a different elevator than the main elevators) until I was literally waiting for my uber at checkout.  Any doorman could have pointed out there is a better way to enter and exit the hotel. There is only one sign that is marked ""Auto Mall"" - no idea why I would expect to that to have been an entrance."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everytging Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"it was amazing, well worth it."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"-Nice infinity pool at the top 
-Sea view 
-Room is clean and good for one night during your lay in Colomb
-Staff is very kind 
-Funny to go the mall directly through the elevator in the lobby  -We get a smoking room which is not very pleasant.
-It was quite difficult to get a taxi or an Uber (hotel is not very famous yet and it seems that the localisation is confusing with marina Casino)"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"All things went well. A little expensive for this one. Honestly, u can enjoy the sea view in many cities in Sri Lanka. It's more cheap there."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Very comfortable, big rooms and high quality services. Breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of choises, both asian ans european."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The roof top pool & garden are excellent. Ramsheed in reception is extremely helpful & courteous. Beautiful rooms, very clean. Room service menu very good. Pool bar staff good too. "

"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The room was exceptional and the rooftop pool and garden were lovely! We ordered cocktails on the roof - they were probably the worst cocktails we've ever had and weren't cheap.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Size of the room Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The beds and the shower Food @ Tide Restaurant, salty not well prepared"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,The room was amazing and the bed was really comfortable. The rooftop infinity pool was the main reason we stayed here and it didn't disappoint. We had to check out and then hang around till the evening for our flight and we relaxed by the pool on the roof all day which was great. Breakfast buffet was also good. The food could have been better at the Tides restaurant for dinner and the service for dinner and breakfast wasn't great. People kept forgetting our drinks orders.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Other than that we had a wonderful stay and would stay there again.  Pillows could be a bit firmer. The other thing I found was that the boys on room cleaning duty had to be reminded every day about cleaning the room even though the cleaning sign was left on in the morning. They seemed to go past not noticing the sign. We used to be out all morning and would come back in the afternoon to find that the room hadn't been cleaned. After reminding them then they would come and clean the room. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The rooftop pool and bar is excellent!  Nothing to complain about. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Proof top swimming pool and garden 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very cool rooftop infinity pool Not much to say here
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location and just like the photos. View and sunsets from the rooftop pool are AMAZING! Room was really comfortable and clean. There is a mall attached which has a good variety of shops if you need and there are also shops walking distance to the hotel. We did not want to leave so would definitely stay again. We were not told at check-in that we were required to put credit onto the room to order drinks, food etc.  The staff at the pool were really un-impressed and were constantly keeping an eye on us to make sure we were going to pay before leaving, even though our room number was provided. It didn't affect our stay that much and would not have been a problem if we were told, we just felt really uncomfortable when trying to relax."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Fantastic pool and great service
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Roof top infinity pool and garden and a sea facing/ partial sea facing room with balcony. These was also a mall attached to the property that opened up on Galle Main Road. The roof top pool is amazing for sunsets. We had a small problem with the travel arrangements but Mr. Praia’s was very courteous and fixed it for us immediately. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The pool was amazing! And great value! Hot water was a little temperamental in our shower 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"One of the most amazing hotels I have stayed at. Pool was absolutely breath taking. Overlooking the skyline and out to see, there are sun longer in and around the pool to relax on and a range of drinks and food options to have by the pool. The buffet at night was fantastic, so many options of food and dessert. Can not recommend enough, only wish I could have stayed longer."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"From check in with the lovely lady at the check in desk, greeted with a lovely drink after a long journey was great. She ensured we were given an upgrade as it was our first wedding anniversary which was so kind of her. The room wasn't ready so we got a pass for the pool while we waited. The room was amazing, sea view with an amazing balcony. Bed was so comfortable and massive. Gorgeous big bathtub in the room too. Mini bar was complimentary snacks and soft drinks. Lots of tasty teas to choose from too. We also discovered a lovely cake in our room when we got in to the room saying happy anniversary on it. Such a nice touch and the staff from the concierge, cleaning staff, bar and restaurant to the life guards everyone was just incredibly friendly and smiling alot. Great atmosphere in the hotel due to this. We went for the breakfast buffet which was really good value for money there was absolutely huge choices available. The food and drink in the hotel is all actually very reasonable, I would have expected it to be quite expensive and over priced but I didnt find that at all. I was just here 1 night and the day I left i had a night flight but i had full pool access all day too which was great. I would 100% stay here again and also for more than 1 night. Thanks so much Marino Beach you really made our anniversary very special. When I had to leave "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"- the room had everything. King bed, sitting area, terrace, free minibar, Ironboard&iron, slippers, bathrobes, many mirrors, very, very silent airco,....- carpets in the hallways create silence. Hard floor in the room- bathroom and toilet all glass but you can lower a screen to the bedroom for privacy.  Bath and rainshower seperately, make-up mirror, heated mirror,....- a roof top infinity pool with garden (grass, trees, palmtrees,...) and nice bar (also snacks)- they arranged taxi to the airport for only 15 Usd !- late check-out and even later access to the poolarea- realy top score ""value for money"" Nothing in the hotel.The mall in the same building=😢"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Great pool and pool area. Central location.  Spacious room. Not sure if the soundproofing is bad or if our neighbors were particularly loud but we didn’t get much sleep because of party people next to us. Hotel explicitly “prohibits” loud talking and music but after we complained at the reception staff didn’t intervene strongly enough to make the noise stop.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything about it. Room, staff, facilities, infinity pool. Much better value than the Kingsbury for pretty much the same thing Nothing at all. "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,The room is amazing. And the rooftop The assistant refuse to call a tuktuk for me because I didn't book the day before.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Infinity pool is amazing,

Really amazing hotel, the staff have been really nice and extremely helpful. I injured my foot and the assistant manager Firzaad helped me to go to the hospital and ensure that every thing was good. Truly appreciated the amazing care and the personal touch. I would definitely stay again.  Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Great hotel, convenient and it was perfect for us as we only stayed there 1 night before flying back home. Lovely staff and great hospitality. Very spacious and modern rooms. Even though the hotel has a fantastic roof top, it lacked character and charm. The restaurants also felt a little cold which is a shame as we would have liked to eat dinner there but ended up eating elsewhere."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Nice and clean room, comfortable bed, excellent infinity pool and awesome breakfast  None"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The rooftop ool was lovely in addition to the poolside bar which served a good selection of snacks and drinks. Breakfast was expensive and very average. Strange club bar on roof. Would be a nice bar but have tried to make it into a nightclub.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Clean new building , personal was very nice. Very good breakfast. Noise from near building site. Overall good experience."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The staff is great, breakfast is very very good and big value for money, the swimming pool, garden around it and gym are absolutely amazing. Beer by the pool is very reasonably priced. We requested non-smoking room and we were given such on obviously smoking floor. Everything was fine until the last 2 nights when we got new neighbour that was smoking like chimney. The smoke was flowing directly to our room. Ventilation of the hotel needs to be improved.Airport taxi is ripoff. We were charged 40USD from airport to hotel. On the way back we booked Uber (with surge pricing) for less then 15USD."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Pool is amazing Location is not great - seems to be in the business area - so fine if you don’t want to leave the hotel but not if you want to walk everywhere
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The swimming pool on the 10th Floor was spectacular as was the garden setting.  The whole experience was wonderful as were all the staff.  The breakfast offering had everything - no fault to be found with anything. Although we had booked 3 Deluxe King Rooms 1 of the rooms was a disabled room (which we didn't realise until we had unpacked) and was not mentioned when we checked in.  However The Customer Relations guy was very helpful.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The breakfast was excellent with a great view of the sea from the balcony. The staff were super helpful and did as much as they could to assist.

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Lovely facilities, especially pool area. Spacious comfy rooms. One of the rooms we were put in was a smoking room and smelt horribe. We were not asked our preference. I was charged twice. They asked to “preauthorise” my credit card but actually charged it and then again on checkout. I left the hotel almost 1 week ago and am still trying to get a refund after many emails and finally a call to the hotel today. Very poor service."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Amazing pool, really good breakfast, especially the local food and clean, decent spec rooms Generally all good, I did ask to check out at 1pm vs. 12 which was rejected which was a bit of a shame"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing from the beginning to the end! Everything in this hotel has been perfect. Rooms are very spacious and the bathroom is equipped with everything you possibly need during your stay. The restaurant has amazing food and is reasonably priced. 
If you want to watch television in your room, there are plenty of (premium) channels for you to watch. Tv channels include HBO, Al Jazeera, BBC etc. 
The swimming pool is also amazing with a beautiful view over the ocean. Even if all the outdoor pool beds are taken, the staff will happily place some thin mattresses on the nearby grass field for you, so you can lie down."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff were polite, helpful and flexible. The rooms were spacious and the swimming pool was great too. Initially we booked double twin bed room but they offered us king size bed without additional cost. The check out time was at midday and when we told them our flight was in the evening, they offered us to use the swimming pool facility until the evening. They were absolutely superb! I will definitely stay in this hotel if l go back to Colombo."

The facilities are great but the staff is more than forgetful and does not care much about clients. In the Cinnamon hotel where I went after my stay at the Marino Beach they do it much better with a  Birthday Carol, small cake etc. Also check in took around 15 minutes without queues, way too long. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,All. Beware of tuk tuk drivers harrowing and trying to overcharge you. Ask the staff for help.

The pool is definitely the highlight They need us to pay right before you check in which is slightly inconvenient and the food we ordered for in room dining wasn't great at all. Recommend you to eat outside some place "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Good Wi-FiFast check inFriendly staffModern facility Band playing music on roof restaurant was too loud and played too much and too late. Could not charge anything to to room. The bath had a glass door around the toilet which served no purpose and was in the way."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Lovely hotel, with friendly staff, a gorgeous infinity pool, and very comfortable rooms. 
We stayed here our first night in Sri Lanka, and after a long journey im really glad we chose Marino Beach as our first stop. We wanted to go for something reasonably upmarket, but not for an intermational chain where you could be in Hong Kong or New York and not know the difference. This hotel was perfect! "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The ocean view from premier room is really nice.
If you like the complete ocean view like full window blue, you should choose the most expensive room.
We stayed as the last hotel in my 12 days staying in Sri lanka.
We could enjoy the infinity pool and the nice restaurant.
Thank you. We couldn’t get hat water from 23PM to 10AM.
I heard it was a maintenance from front desk.
But we could hear that the shower improved.
This made us uncomfortable.
And when we take the dinner of buffet at 2nd floor, we were taken to the table which is close to the leftovers dealing space despite so many tables are available.
So we requested to change table.
I hope 5 stars hotel  get more high quality."

Then she completed my tasks. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Gym was fantastic. It is almost fully equipped. Has heavy dumbbells and even a deadlift set up. Treadmills are in excellent condition as well. Infinity pool is wonderful. Pretty similar to mbs Wifi spotty disconnects frequently cost me an airline ticket spot. Food kinda meh. 
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Good location and facilities. A little away from the hub but still close enough.Found the property a little pricy but facilities and restaurants were great !! Hot water wasn't available in the morning. Took sometime to fix it. For the price we are paying, there should be some backup plan for such failures.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Stayed for four nights at this amazing hotel, we were only supposed to stay there for two nights but decided to extend because it was so wonderful! The rooms were so beautiful and the bed's increadably comfortable. Great restaurants with so many options that you could hardly choose what to have. The roof top infinty pool was also one of highlights of our trip with an amazing view, especially during sunset. The hotel staff were all very nice and always willing to help in any way possible. Special thanks to the manager Ramsheed who went above and beyond to make our stay as amazing as it could be, making sure everything was up to standard and even giving us great advice on what to see and where to eat in this amazing city.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone planning on staying in Colombo, will definetly be coming back! 🙂"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We loved everything about the property. The location was very good, facing the sea, on Galle Road which is busy with many shops and good public transport. We also loved the staff who were always very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help us have the best experience. The food was excellent, both the international breakfast and the buffet dinner, great service. Lastly, the infinity pool is really a big deal, beautiful, nice and warm with great facilities. All in all it is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying and I would definitely go back if I find myself in Colombo again.  Everything was excellent! ! ! Keep up the good work ! "

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Lovely room, very comfortable, clean, reasonably spacious.Service excellent, friendly & attentive staff.Great pool on roof.Competitive money exchange rates at reception, should you find yourself short of local currency. Overall, the hotel has a somewhat impersonal feel - it is more of a conference hotel than a holiday hotel.Roof-top restaurant did not have a great vibe, we ate in the adjacent shopping mall - great value local dishes!"

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,The rooftop pool.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Definitely enjoyed the room, the breakfast buffet, the fact that we could just take an elevator ride to the nearby shopping mall and the attached restaurants. We had one situation where a vendor inside the mall wouldn't honor the discount as advertised by the hotel, but once we discussed it with the hotel, they took care of things. A little awkward but it worked out in the end."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Breakfast buffet and service was great
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything else. Didn't know how to get the slider screen in the bath down.. we spent an hour trying to figure it out:) Also the chairs in the balcony could be more comfortable 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Lovely modern hotel with great rooftop area and swimming pool. Perfect for short stay before going onto explore other parts of Sri Lanka.  Lots of building work going on around it so can be noisy when you are by the pool. 
Location, bit of a walk if you go out for dinner and streets are quite dark. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The pool and garden area on the roof is really amazing! The room was big and had a very comfortable bed.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool on the roof is very nice. All employees very well trained and professional.  The equipment of the room was also very good."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was excellent 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel is fantastic in all respects
I would like to thank the reception team, especially the girls, for their help and thank them for standing up during the work to welcome them, welcome them and help them"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The pool was great and the gym also had good equipment. The beds were really comfortable and slept very well. It was also very clean and the hotel staff were incredibly accommodating especially when we had a late arrival. The pool could be a little crowded at times but other than that no complaints.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The design of the hotel gives as best view of the ocean to as many rooms as possible - including the roof top pool and open air part of the restaurant.MUCH better value than the 'Galle lawns' group of hotels which are over-priced.One particular point of note: the team running the hotel restaurant at breakfast are probably the best I've experienced anywhere - and I've travelled a lot.  Running a high volume, 'buffet machine' for breakfast at hotels like this is hard to get right.  The balance between efficiency and not making guest feel rushed is tricky - but the team here this morning did a fantastic job.  Very polite, and very quick with additional orders, quick to clear used crockery and cutlery but without making you feel chased away.  And the food variety and quality was similarly good.  Great job restaurant team!The room was bright and airy, well equipped and spotless. Nothing really major at all - it was a very good experience.  A couple of things to consider:- The pool is great, but there are not enough places to sit.  The 'deck' could be better utilised with more loungers and shades, for example.  Similarly, more tables and chairs in the roof top café would help with busy periods.- For some reason there are two sources of music in the lifts, playing different things.  This is a bit silly and should be fixed.  One appears to be from the general hotel PA system, the other from the advertising TV screen in the lift."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff were amazing, hotel was beautiful and the breakfast and pool were outstanding. And they made a heart towel for my travel penguin buddy!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Our stay at Marino Beach Hotel was amazing. The hotel has all the facilities you may require including a gym, spa, restaurants, and rooftop pool area. The rooftop infinity pool is the real highlight of this hotel, especially at sunset. 
The room was clean, spacious and comfortable with ocean view balcony. Staff were really friendly. Special mention goes to the lobby Manager, Mr. Ramsheed, he was very welcoming and helpful, making our staying at Marino Beach an unforgettable experience.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone planning on staying in colombo."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The hotel is very well maintained, clean and comfortable. 
Breakfast restaurant offers both local and European dishes, so you can find what suits you best.
Roof top swimming pool and lounge area with bar give you the chance to relax in the middle of the city.
The place is highly recommended for a business trip or a stopover.
All the staff members were very helpful and did spend time with me to answer questions and provide all the information I needed. 1. The place is surrounded by noisy building grounds, but Colombo is developing very fast, so there are building grounds everywhere. One just needs to accept the state of things.
2. When I asked to organize an airport transfer for me, I was asked to provide the entire credit card data by email. When I suggested to either pay cash or add the taxi cost to my hotel room, the staff member still replied that booking a taxi was only possible having my full CC data. Of course I refused to provide it and just took the official taxi in the airport."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"...great pool and rooftop
...helpful staff
...great breakfast buffet 
...spacious and cozy room ...dusty balcony because of construction beside the hotel - just a minor thing for us...everything else was great"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Marino Beach was our first stop on a 2 week trip around Sri Lanka. We wanted something comfortable for our first few nights in Colombo before we left the city for the Southern Province. 
It was a great location, right near the beach and just set back enough from the general hubub of city life. 
The staff were really friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble and we were even told at check in that we had a free upgrade. 
Really well equipped pool and gym area and the buffet restaurant serves fab local food if you’re not in the mood for popping out into the city and just want something hassle free, delicious and easy. 
And all-in-all fantastic experience, would 100% stay again."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Roof top pool and views Nothing at all

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Amazing rooftop infinity pool and bar, which is the highlight of this hotel, especially at sunset. Very comfortable and clean rooms. Breakfast was amazing, great selection and high quality. Staff were really friendly. Lift from the hotel lobby to a shopping centre makes accessing an ATM really easy.  View from the balcony isn’t amazing (side view of sea and a few building sites), but this is not really an issue with the amazing rooftop just upstairs. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"great location, breakfast excellent and staff attentive and caring. views of the sea and surrounding areas breathtaking and so relaxing.  I couldn't have asked for a better start to my holiday There was nothing to dislike! All was excellent from start to finish"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It was very luxury, clean and nice hotel with very good service!
Especially would like to thank manager Ramsheed Jainulabdeen who fixed a little problem we had in a minutes and in a very good way. 
Breakfast was amazing - buffet style breakfast where you can choose almost between everything you can imagine! 
Infinity pool on the rooftop is just the best way to start your holiday after long flight;)"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"DINUKA from the garden bar was so professional, he’s well spocken in English just so happy,smiling & and nothing was to much trouble...he deserves to be promoted...😁We absolutely loved swimming in the overflow pool on the 10th floor where the pool meats the ocean...watching the trains go by, the fab sunset. The garden with proper grass, trees for shade & the lovely flowers was a lovely touch ...we loved this place and will be back. Having to leave 😱"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Great location, amazing infinity pool. Tasty in-room dining service. Nicely furnished room and great shower After cleaning the room they did not provide a new set of bathroom toiletries nor did they refill the consumed tea bags."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Food tasted great, devil's prawn dish very spicy (equivalent of vindaloo spicy)
Staff were so friendly, helpful, and attentive. Megha the manger big thank you to him for making me feel really comfortable and welcome. No hair dryer in room. 
Breakfast wasn't included in price."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Roof top pool and bar were amazing! Staff were always around to help and very smiley and welcoming. There was glass patrician separating the toilet and bedroom and our electric blind didn’t work so we had to use the toilet with no privacy unfortunately"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Marino beach hotel is beautiful. Its quite expensive but it is worth it. The infinity pool is stunning and you can watch the sunset from there. Breakfast is totally amazing. Would stay here again. Highly recommended
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Watching the sunset from the pool was dreamy. It’s quite a new hotel and a much better alternative to Cinnamon! There’s not much of yard space which made travelling via UberTuk so much easier. There’s a so-called “mall” at the 2nd floor. It’s not really much, but there’s an okay-ish food court and souvenir shop. The breakfast was wholesome and good. The meats could be improved and a change in their menu would’ve been great but that’s just me being picky. Just FYI: The beach opposite the hotel is not really accessible (you need to walk a mile or so and even then it’s not the nicest). Anyway Colombo is not known for it’s beaches. But the location is perfect. Availabity of bath salts would be nice."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Excellent location.
Modern and luxurious.
Value for money. No floor mat outside the bathroom for wiping of feet after bath ."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Pool area, the food, rooms, reseption, everything was really nice! Maybe more relaxing beds at the pool area."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Functional and convenient They charged a deposit to my credit card when I checked in to prepay any incidental expenses. I settled the bill when I left. A few days after checkout I found they had not deducted my charges from the deposit and refunded the difference. Instead both my deposits and charges were on the credit card. I called from the US and had to ask them to refund the deposit. The hotel is unfair employing this practice by causing a problem with the guest and taking advantage of the credit card system to increase cash flow.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Loved the roof top pool
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"For being a big hotel this was a really really nice one! Great view, fab breakfast, nice staff and beautiful pool and leisure area!!! Nice and clean!!"

The pool Different prices for the same thing in the different restaurants/ bars.
No air con in the changing facilities by the pool area."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Breakfast  was good. King coconut water was something i never expected or never had in any of hotel so far. Having king coconut water for the breakfast was fulfilling but it lacked taste. The Hotel lobby wasn't that attractive. Should have concentrated more on the interior work.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Friendly, helpful and attentive staff. Always smiling!
Nice long pool.
Lots of choice at breakfast."

Food was extremely good both for dinner and breakfast, staff were very attentive. Highly recommend Marino Beach Nothing, it was perfect."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Our stay was amazing! Perfect ending to our trip. The room is more comfortable than you can believe, the pool and top floor are lovely and relaxing, and the food is also incredible! Exactly what we needed!

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Facilities and staff were excellent. Breakfast and location.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"My girlfriend and I booked the Marino Beach Colombo based on the previous reviews and we had an excellent stay there. The rooms are amazing, the staff is very friendly and the breakfast is outstanding. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is staying in Colombo. -"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"We organised a taxi from the airport with Marino Beach as they have a taxi kiosk in arrivals which was very helpful. The room was fanatic - really comfortable beds, Great shower and a balcony with ocean views. 
We were only in Colombo one night before setting off north of the country, however we did have time to enjoy the infinity pool on the roof and the breakfast. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a bit of luxury comfort in Colombo.  The only negative I can see about this place is that it's a little bit out of the center, but that's no issue as there a tuk tuks everywhere and also the hotel can provide taxis too. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very beautiful..we enjoiy well.thank all staff. Fool is very beautifull.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"What's not to like, good location,beautiful and large rooms with really friendly and helpful staff and a brilliant infinity pool on top of the hotel. If I'm being picky maybe more sun loungers around swimming pool area."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Rosheen and Richell at the loby/check in were lovely and really helpful.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Spacious and comfortable room. Exceptional choice at breakfast Standard of service to be improved (forgot to clean my room, slow room service, post check-out hotel was not responsive over email when I requested a soft copy of my invoice."

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Gym. Swimmingpool. Room and the bed was very comfortabel. Breakfast buffet was good
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Great pool and rooftop garden
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Service was great, very professional.
English capability of staff was excellent.
We were upgraded for no additional cost.
We were given a late check out at no cost.
Given our late flight out, they let us continue to use the facilities until late in the evening no worries, even after we checked out! This includes using the rooftop pool, which was excellent!
 Food in the restaurants within the complex was really expensive, but I guess that's to be expected. We were caught out by two ""lime and sodas"" that were over $5USD each.
Hallways smelled like smoke, I guess this was a smoking friendly hotel?"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Attitude of Grill Bar Black Blazer guy believ his name was Damit...was honestly shocked the way he threw the menus on the table and almost ignored us. But the waiters of the restaurant were excellent. They made our evening. Little gems I would say. Also the black Blazer guy standing by the roof top open air bar was horrible. Huge ego problems...but well who cares 😊😊😊
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The rooms were comfortable the breakfast great and the swimming a dream! Everything was perfect! Great experience!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Great rooftop swimming pool! Front road can be noisy
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The rooftop infinity pool was stunning, giving breathtaking views of the blue ocean. The carvenous lobby was sparkling with highly polished marble flooring and overly bright ceiling lights. This gave a cold feeling at first entry into the hotel. They should consider breaking this with a decorative feature in the centre with colourful floral display to add a nice touch to the shimmering marble floor and ceiling."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The location, the rooms, the pool, the view. The breakfast was the best."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The pool and facilities were amazing. The breakfast buffet had a very good selection. I wasn’t keen on the glass wall in the bathroom. A bit of privacy around the toilet area would have been better.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"I absolutely loved my stay here; this hotel is luxurious and the rooms, facilities and communal areas are done up to an incredibly high standard. The highlight for me was watching the sunset from the infinity pool I got the impression that there is nothing to do outside of the hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Nicely appointed room Average food in the restaurant
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"food was great, buffet style breakfast for all nationalities, pool was wonderful, shopping mall under hotel was good, spent a small fortune. room was comfortable and modern, room service offered and the food was nice.Staff in restaurants and poor were wonderfully friendly and polite. The hotel was clean, modern and high end.The town itself Colombo is immense and there a loads of shopping opportunities in malls and streets, we did and open top bus tour which was brilliant, it gives you a good sense of where to go when you want to explore independently yourselves but you would potentially need a few days if you wanted to see everything Colombo has to offer. We personally felt the reception staff looked down their noses which tainted some of the experience, they were quite abrupt and matter of fact and even untrusting, the hotel will only take cash advances or credit card details and not debit card details which is what we wanted to use, so we had to inconveniently go and withdrawer cash and leave twice as much as we were going to spend on our evening meals/expenses/mini bar etc with them in a drawer in reception because they wont let you use a debit card. The staff in other parts of the hotel like restaurants and pool were lovely and friendly though, it was only front of house/desk staff both foyer including the transport desk who weren't really helpful eitherWe also had a partially power cut/blown fuses on our second night and had to inconveniently move rooms, we were told if we move they will upgrade us to a better room and help with our luggage, we got moved to an exact same room and had to carry our own luggage, we got no additional good will gesture for our inconvenience.The beach is not suitable for sunbathing as its all rocks and has the train line running parallel and the water is polluted so if you're after a beach holiday Columbo isn't the place. They is a also a lot of construction (spoils the view a little with all the cranes)in Columbo and it's becoming a massive tourist destination now, we're looking forward to seeing the progression when we go back in a year or 2."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Very nice and attentive staff. Clean and spacious room. Attractive roof garden and pool. Sandwiched between two busy and poisonous roads. Construction noise next door. Sea very polluted. Endless canned music in the garden.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great hotel and very friendly
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The room was very clean and comfortable. Well equipped, nice bathroom. View from the balcony was amazing. Awesome rooftop pool and garden. Highly recommended."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It was by far the best hotel that we stayed in in Sri Lanka. The food is really good and the variety of the buffet will meet anyone’s wishes. The infinity pool on top is superb! After checkout we got a pass for the swimming  pool because we still had some time before our flight left. In the morning we had breakfast and twice we where told that they would bring food to the table so they could prepare it in peace and twice we didn’t get it.But that’s not a  big problem at all."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Rooms excellent comfort
Great location
Very nice Swimming pool area  Service at the front desk ineficient
Except for one person .
Nobody realy helps you to get a taxi at correct rate, ineficient excursion desk.
Decoration of lobby and breakfast area , very cold, can be improved.
Plants palms, paintings...looks like a aeroport corridor."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"It's a beautiful hotel. Great facilities. The pool was wonderful. Not really walking distance into town, breakfast was expensive. It was either all or nothing with the breakfast. They quoted prices without service charge and taxes which is a bit of a catch."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The swimming pool was amazing.  The staff extremely polite. Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Jude concierge' service is excellent
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Pool with sea view, location, room environment A Staff in the pool area is poluted and rude. They thought everyone wear shirt at the pool are voyeurism."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything it was amazing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Lovely new hotel with friendly staff, lovely food and a great gym. High teas were amazing. Great swimming pool. Great swimming pool but lacked shade and lounges."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything. What a way to end a perfect holiday in Sri Lanka. Without sought, will stay here again next time I visit this country. Absolutely love my stay. I love the Buddist people, but it was so hot when I arrived, I really needed a beer or two. However this was not possible due to a Buddist holiday. As a result no liquor served any where in the hotel. I understand that this is a predominantly Buddist country, but how about a couple of beers in the room bar fridge. Then I could have a beer in private without upsetting anyone of the Buddist faith.many thanks for everything else."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Staffs are friendly and amazing view of sunset, and we enjoyed our stays"
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Very good
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"It was exactly opposite sea and it was very a sexy property.managers Ramsheed and tinush were very good . They accompanied and helped us in every possible way..Special mention about Ramsheed, he was very kind and explained everything in detail.. kudos to the entire team .. it’s worth for the stay  No negative comments .."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The roof top pool makes it all worth it I didn't like the very slow check in process. I didn't want to be required to get all of the coupons. I was ready to check in after a long flight. The room door didn't close all the way. You had to slam it."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Brand new property  Food was pretty basic and pricey 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Roof top swiming pool & food is good. I was staying there 2nd time, march 21-24th,but they gave me horrible room, and when i asked for upgrade as a repeating guest reception boy told me its a better room (i know  how your rooms looks like at least dont lie to ur guest). 
And guess what room was on 3floor facing noisy  constructions, outdated furnitures, should be partically sea view, but huge grass terrase was covering all that, and next day when i asked to change room they told me they dont have any available rooms asked me to try next day. Thank you for doing nothing.    "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Loved the comfortable room and lovely views ,  the bathroom was spectacular and the food was phenomenal Room service did not have carts to serve the meal in the room"

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The pool Building work surrounding the hotel
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The outdoor pool is amazing and the staff are extremely helpful, professional and polite. The hotel food is very good and we were well looked after particularly by the breakfast team.  The location is a short tuk tuk ride from the centre of Colombo without a nearby beach which may not suit everyone. However as a place to relax around the lovely pool for me it was ideal. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Love the rooftop pool n garden. I think it would be nice to keep a small table on the balcony
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Location, view, hospitality, cleanses, actually every thing. The breakfast was good but it could be by far much better if they recheck food list and upgrade it."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Nice  Nice 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Nice bedroom The tour service was inaccurate. I specifically requested to see tea field, ask to the driver before took off, then they taked me to a tea factory and denial me to see what I ask for. Beside it was way too expensive"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The infinity pool and the amazing ocean view! Wonderful breakfast buffet. Staff were very friendly  The service to use their drivers is pretty expensive (ie to and from airport) 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was very well taken care of and always cleaned.. location is great and the scenery is beautiful I would have enjoyed some music while chilling in the infinity pool as it can get a bit noisy from people around, music would definitely improve the experience"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Location, price food No"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Hotel Rooftop has amazing view
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great hotel with very good facilities; amazing swimming pool on the roof top; comfy rooms with everything you may need all good :)
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything - especially 53 metre infinity pool and pool bar/cafe and best hotel gym I have ever used, Nothing!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything was great!
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Lovely room, roof top swimming pool, great balcony view over Indian Ocean. The breakfast buffet was top class, huge variety of choices and the most attentive friendly staff.Everything was high class (except check in ) Checking in was too long . We arrived at the stated 14:00 check in time, told the rooms were being prepared. Nearly 2 hours of tired waiting before rooms available."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Located on the back of a new mall and facing the beach in a nice part of the city. Plenty of good dining options around the hotel (and inside). It's a very large building with a very nice rooftop garden and jacuzzi area. Room was clean and modern. Crazy traffic in the area
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Brand new building with lot of amenities. Noice level of the adjacent rooms are unbearable.It seems Acoustical consultant weren’t hired during the building design stage or any noice absorption weren’t considered during the construction.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Rooftop pool is amazing. Food was good and reasonably priced. Spa - massages are incredible. Room spacious and comfortable and soundproof to the noise from outside. While some staff are friendly and helpful others don’t seem to really know what is going on. Perhaps training is an issue. The fact that you are unable to run a tab - even for a few hours while at the pool bar is unusual and it’s rather annoying to have to pay for each drink / food as you have it. Feels like there is no trust when you are made to pay for everything upfront. We were also not informed that it was possible to pay an amount to the reception to use in the outlets until the second day of our stay - if we had been told of this on arrival it might have been easier. We were staying for a visa application and had forgotten to bring one colour copy of the passport, when asked at the travel desk if we could print in colour the answer was no. When asked if there was somewhere nearby they knew we could go, the answer was also no. When I asked another staff member he very easily told me where to go in the mall. This is one example of some staff being friendly and helpful while others were unwilling to help / didn’t know what was happening. Unfortunately we tried to get a late check-out until 3/4pm as our flight was in the evening but they could only give us until 1pm - which we can understand if it’s busy. They were kind to give us entrance to the pool area after the check out before our taxi."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Loved the infinity pool, Sea facing balcony rooms, cordial staff, great buffets and room service.  No alcohol in the mini bar. It's good to have an option, just incase. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Only stayed a couple of nights at the end of our 14 day tour of south Sri Lanka but would have stayed longer the hotel is the best we have stayed at in our trips around Asia the last few years ,the rooms,staff,food,rooftop pool all are excellent ,the staff are always happy to chat and have a sense of humour even after we had beaten them at cricket . And the food is excellent and not overpriced. Nothing probably leaving the hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The breakfast have lots of variety, the swimming pool area is so cosy, the staff is ultra friendly, there's a connection in the hotel to a mall and a bar. The toilets looks a maze of glass"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,the location and the pool area exceeded my expectations. the best pool in colombo. The rooms are bit noisy you can hear the neighbours and other doors banging. could use some noice canceling.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It was more than expectation ..but time had gone quickly 😁😁
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The bed was incredibly comfy and the room was lovely, bit odd having a window through to the bathroom from the bedroom!Staff were very friendly. Room wasn’t turned around during the day so came back to no water, clean towels or made bed. They did do it once I asked and we went out for dinner.Not enough beds around the pool for all guests. Ended up having on on the sunset Terrace but there was no shade.Surprised when ordering drinks that the service charge and local tax wasn’t included...WiFi was present all over the hotel, even up by the pool but the connection speed was very poor"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The pool and garden were amazing. Get up there early to get a lounger in the pool. The food and drinks were very tasty and reasonably priced. Would 100% stay here again. Welcome drink on arrival and free car to the casinos.  Everything was great. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,its amazing hotel and the staff is fantastic the room is excellent and comfortable good staff good service
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"everything is amazingthe rooms are super clean and hugethe pool on the rooftop is stunning and relaxingthe garden bar has great food the evening buffet is expensive and was not that amazing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,All excellent and loved the pool with the roof garden.  All excellent and loved the pool with the roof garden. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The staff were all amazing from all departments. From a friendly welcome early in the morning and help to organize transport for the next day to a daily smile and greeting from housekeeping ensuring I had everything I needed in the room. The staff really couldn’t do enough to help and ensure that my stay in Sri Lanka was enjoyed. Such a positive experience of traveling alone and I will certainly be back. I have already recommended the hotel to friends who I know will just love it! Nothing not to like.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"So luxury! Spacious room, extraordinary bathroom. Of course the main thing was on the top of the hotel. You can feel like in the different world. Infinitive pool, garden, restaurant, bar. WOW. Perfect for closing your holiday in this country."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent location, very helpful staff, good big modern rooms, nice view, the breakfast is very big and a lot has a lot of options, I consider it as the best breakfast in Colombo area. A/C is performance so and so, the control panel is not easy to operate and if it works for a long time you can sense humidity in the room."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Excellent pool with nice views. Very attentive and friendly staff. Very good restaurant in the mall. Nice room. Balcony is very open e.g no privacy. If you want to pay services etc. on your room account, the credit card must be ”extra” verified. There was a notice about it in the reception, but we just didn’t pay enough attention to it. It might be a could idea to ask when checking in, if the customer wants to use his room account for payments."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"it is a great hotel with amazing views and the best one is the infinity pool and the sea view from the pool, definitely worth. nothing as such"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,swimming pool is wonderful!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The sunsets
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Hotel really good service,front office staff was excellent Supun and Kalana really helpful at check in also Fantastic manager Mr. Ramsheed really helpful and good PR. I used to stay at cinnamon lake but now i will definitely stay in Marino beach because of the best service.  Pool is really nice over roll good 5star hotel. Leving from this place."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was fantastic! Rally enjoyed staying in Marino Beach Hotel. We regret we didn’t stay for more days
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The pool and breakfast is incredible The location
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"- The hotel is a good start for being introduced to Sri Lanka and for a relaxing time after the flight
- The rooftop swimming pool
- large comfortable bed room
- Taxi service from the airport
 We were limited to staying at the hotel because the city of Colombo doesn't provide too much leisure."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Loved the infinity pool
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We had 3 nights here and have to say that the roof top pool, bar and restaurant are breathtaking. The lobby is beautiful and their evening pianist is fabulous. The restaurant food is absolutely gorgeous and the rooms are very nice too and very clean. We had a lovey time here watching the world go by from the roof! The service was a bit hit and miss at check in when they tried to give us a twin instead of a king. We refused and this was soon rectified although we had to call reception 3 times before getting the key to our 2nd room. The last night we called reception twice as there was maintenance work being carried out until midnight in a neighbouring room, we wasted reception in the morning what was the problem and they said they didn’t receive a noise complaint. We enjoyed our stay here and would return, this is due to the amazing roof and their lovely staff up there and the beautiful restaurant. Our balcony was very odd with no table and just a few plastic chairs. I feel the balcony space is wasted massively on the city view side of the hotel. "

Staff at the garden, same floor as the rooftop, most were great, a couple of others, not so much. Drinks were good, food was decent enough.Breakfast Buffet was fab! The staff at the lobby snack/bar area! They  couldn't bother to look if anyone needed anything, I literally had to keep waving my arms to get attention. VERY annoying."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Great location, awesome pool. A clean and new hotel! there wasn't too much I didn't like, perhaps a better stocked mini bar."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was perfect about this place.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Food very good..English fish and chips perfect...breakfast buffet amazing...everything possible available. Music from grand piano in lobby very soothing. Staff professional and friendly...not impersonal. Bathroom could have been bigger. Toilet awkward  angle and entrance not ideal.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The perfect hotel to start or finish your trip through Sri Lanka. The comfortable rooms and amazing rooftop pool and facilities are the ideal way to relax after or before a long flight.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Big spacious room, very comfortable. The staff are all very friendly. The view from the pool is great, and a nice place to chill. We used the gym several times, which had all new equipment, and was exceptional. The breakfast in the main restaurant is awesome, so much variety. We love Sri Lankan food, and they had everything and more. Plus western food if you want it (but you're in Sri Lanka so why not try the amazing cuisine!). We loved our stay which was at the beginning of our trip, and are staying there again at the end of our trip too. There's a reason why this place has such a high rating. Highly recommend."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great view of the ocean, convenient location, clean, friendly staff, good breakfast, a mall connected to the hotel, the rooftop infinity pool is spectacular at sunset Wifi was very slow"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Every thing   fabulous  Fantastic 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Starting from the welcome drink to the breakfast buffet , it was perfect...the room and bathroom was spacious and exceptionally clean ... the infinity pool was amazing ...Good job Marino ... Since Colombo is hot at this month , wished the central Ac had more power ..it took few hours to cool down the room ..."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The roof top pool was the best! You have a nice view of the surroundings and the beach with the train running by. Especially at sunset the view is amazing. The roof top is also nice to sit and relax and have a swim. It was not very crowded. The hotel looks very chic and luxury, as well as the hallway and the room. The rooms were spacious enough and had everything you need, for example bathrobes, slippers, soap etc. Even a free minibar! The bathroom was equipped with a bath and separate shower. The location of the hotel was not very inspiring. Though it is located at the sea side, there is no beach or things to do at the beach side. For more restaurants you should go to Colombo 1. Also the mall in the same building as the hotel was not very interesting, as there were mostly furniture shops in the mall, apart from a food court and some clothing or gift shops."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Incredible rooftop pool area Upstairs beers should have been served in glass rather than plastic!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel was luxury, very clean and the location was perfect."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The best part of the hotel was the infinity pool and the roof garden. there was a comprehensive breakfast on offer, which was great. the hotel looked dated and the rooms a bit tired. Also the hotel wifi blocked some apps from working ."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"even though the check-in time was 2pm, we got a room by 1pm after waiting 30-40 mins. not all flights after 2pm. they should have something for people who arrive at 8am. what should they do, wait 6 hours ?"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Outstanding service, amazing room and amenities. Pool was awesome. Breakfast was delicious Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amazing infinity pool
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The rooftop pool is spectacular! Worth staying here for that alone. Long enough for a proper swim but also perfect for cocktails at sunset.Good selection at breakfast - the usual fruit, cereal and continental as well as a superb fresh egg and hopper station, curries, dumplings and even fresh salad. It also had the most efficient service for a large breakfast room I have encountered in a long time. No uncleared tables, constant water, tea and coffee top ups and clean cutlery and napkins appear if you go back for more - you will! Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,We arrived very early after a long flight and the manager was more than happy to arrange for our room to be made up early which meant we didn’t have to wait around. Staff were all extremely friendly and would definitely stay again if going back to Colombo!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The staff at reception were exceptional however the staff in the Garden Bar need a lot of training. Forgot orders, had to order 3 times for a bottle of water, and were very slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Spacious  room No welcome drink and initially felt like a bed and breakfast as staff didn’t approach for help and we had to just que up to register.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The whole experience all of staff couldnt do enough for you, serving drinks by the pool, the rooms were big, clean and well equipped. Ours over looked the ocean. Our bath didnt run water"

We will be back."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Very nice room; unbelievable rooftop pool and garden with bar and restaurant that serve good food The ugly vieuw from the room towards a building site but that’s not in the hotels powe
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"THe hotel food, pool, rooms, and staff Too many kids running up and down the hallways and no one doing anything to quiet them. Not enough lounge chairs on the pool deck. THere is an entire deck that is empty which would be great for chairs. We tried to get our room cleaned the one day and no one ever came. I guess if it doesn't say clean they won't. We had an issue with our first room the people above were extremely loud bu t the staff moved us and upgraded us."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything ! Nothing.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Great facilities. Friendly staff. Lots of breakfast selection. Walking distance to mall. Neat and modern room.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The pool is just awesome. The room and bathroom are separated by glass window which creates a roomy effect. Staff was great, not too creepy. We had a wonderfull four day stay. With the grand entourage you would expext the room to be superclean. We found hairs though on the bed, provided cups contained lipstick and we noticed a used q-tip on the floor. One day the room was not made up. This surprised us."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The room was great, bed and pillows were nice. Available tv channels were a plus. We like the bathroom with all its glass divisions. The lobby was inviting.The access to a mall by walking is also good though we didn’t really find much. The infinity pool is superb! The restaurants are pretty good, specially the chinese resto at 10th floor. Breakfast was also good. Staff are courteous and helpful though can improve English communication. Worth staying in this hotel 😊 The rooms are meant to be sound proof but they weren’t. As mentioned, we had difficulty communicating like finding groceries or another mall. By the name it denotes beach access but its simply a view from the hotel. You have to take a tuktuk or taxi to go to the proper beach area."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Pool was magnificent. Room lovely large and well appointed. Staff were friendly and helpful. Fantastic views. Rooms were not made till late in the day. Bed not made very well.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Infinity pool is great. All staff were very friendly and helpful. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Luxury hotel with stunning infinity pool. Dinner and breakfeast buffet with many different options. Nice small mall downstairs. Great stay for first or last night.  The dinner buffet has many options but is not as high quality as the rest of the hotel. They try real hard but you can taste that you are in a buffet, not a la carte. This is a minor thing, but this is the one thing I would improve. Maybe cut some options and improve the quality. 
Also they could ad a sound system to the tv to make it perfect, but overall I would say we had a great stay. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Great roof top pool and garden. Very helpful staff who made us coffee before the breakfast started as we had to leave early for the airport. The staff retrieved a pair of glasses for us from the airport taxi after we had left and are in the process of returning them to us.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Super comfy bed, air con was great and staff were so lovely A little out of the way of the fort area and the main things in Colombo but only a short tuk tuk ride."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Really enjoyed our stay.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great hotel, friendly staff, rooftop entertainment area Prepayment for room services. Guests should be allowed to pay at the time of check-out."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The in room breakfast was amazing and good value for money. My partner is allergic to nuts and the staff at the Tides restaurant made sure we felt comfortable by having the chef come and show which dishes contained nuts. The next room had their tv so loud in the middle of the night we could not sleep so called reception to complain. We waited ages before they actually turned down the tv but then they did the same thing at 6am waking us up!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing place, beautiful swimming pool, spacious bedroom, helpful people, luxury place, few afordable restaurants, boutique nearby, all services nearby The aircon got difficult to setup"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Great price, rooftop pool and rooms size and comfort."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Generally, the service was excellent. Breakfast provided a great vriety. Had to ask for the room to be cleaned on a couple of occasions. Expected for a Hotel of this stature, should not have had to do that."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Location, pool. Absolute rigmarole checking in, this was the last place we stayed & were blown away by the debacle.
The bathroom had no toilet paper & the toilet hadn't been flushed, this was after we had to wait until 3:30pm for the rooms to be ready."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Fantastic location by the see. Brilliant room with sea view,  fantastic staff.  I Like everything ."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Breakfast is really good.  Hotel planning is also good.  Entrance and lobby area is huge but needs better decoration and space planning. The main road and railway passing in front of the Hotel were not what I was expecting in fact. Somehow the ocean view need to be focused by separation panels between the balconies of the rooms not to see the construction sites, neglected old buildings around and not to disturb the room privacy. We could see inside of the next room from our balcony.Our booking was including mini bar, they said everything complementary but there was only one coke, one sprite and a small can juice.  I'm not counting tea and coffee of course."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The hotel facilities and the ambiance is fantastic. The roof garden and swimming pool are a masterpiece and gives this place a very romantic feel. The cashier collecting the money at the beginning of our stay needs to have a happy smile and more friendly demeanor especially since she is the first person one meets when one enters the hotel"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Food and the service. Excellent swimming pool.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Lovely room and bathroom. Pool amazing and even better than pics! Staff did everything they could to make stay special. Cost of breakfast
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Very modern, clean facilities. The rooftop pool was amazing. Great staff who made you very comfortable. Amazing breakfast!  Couldn’t fault it "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We stayed for two nights as a rest after 12 days travelling in suitcase.  I had prebooked after reading other reviews. The superior deluxe room was beautiful, very clean and well presented.  The outlook was bright and sunny with a small balcony.  The facilities of the hotel are very good and the restaurants very reasonably priced and delicious food. We loved the garden bar next to the rooftop infinity pool.  We ate lunch twice, the food ranged from snacks to meals, western and traditional, our meals were fresh and very reasonably priced. Not to forget the waiters, these guys really looked liked they enjoy their work, attentive, consistently smiling and very obliging.  We also ate in the restaurant on the night of the holiday as most places were closed.  The four of us couldn't decide which restaurant to choose and they gave us the option of being able to order from either menu.  No complaints with the food and service, it was high quality.  Unfortunately we were there on the Easter Sunday bombing and of course nervous about being in the hotel but within a short time there was a solid team of armed guards checking everyone who came through and the staff maintained calm and offered assistance with transport to the airport early.  I should also mention the hotel is adjoined to a shopping centre with a food court and shops for convenience.  After 12 noon check out we were allowed to continue utilising the hotel facilities for the rest of the day until our late flight out.  Would stay again and recommend.  There were mostly couples and a few families with children. No service of alcohol on the holiday.  Being an international hotel with many tourists this policy to restrict the service of alcohol, even via room service,  seemed out of touch.   OK it was only one day but still!Had to wait 1.5 hrs for our rooms to be ready after 2pm checkin time.  Not a problem for me given the late checkout time of 12noon and being busy it was understandable."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,The friendly staff  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Location, Comfort and Welcoming nature Sri Lankans :)  I couldn't get shuttle from Airport to Hotel. Hotel rep said they dont have the curfew pass as it was curfew time at Colombo. It's a Five star hotel, they should have made an alternate arrangement for me."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"What didn’t this place have? Infinity pool, club, two restaurants, gym, spa. What a treat"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Absolutely amazing..... wow
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything! Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Marino Beach was one of the best accommodations we stayed at during our trip. It has absolutely everything you need, with so many facilities to keep you occupied that we never left the hotel! Clean, very comfortable and the staff were helpful and friendly. Highly recommended "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Swimming pool is amazing;
The bar at the top floor is nice and you get nice food a la carte. 
The sunset views were gorgeous.
Staff kept smiling and reassuring despite the horrible time Colombo was going through. Buffet was a bit expensive and not really to our taste.. but that's quite a subjective opinion. We were not planning to eat much at the hotel initially but due to the situation we had to stay indoors (curfew)."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The room was good and comfortable. The swimming pool is great.  The water was cold. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The hotel is beautiful, has a nice cooling atmosphere. Great hotel for unwinding. Had the BEST massage by the ladies in the spa. Please send the food from the chinese restaurant it was PERFECT! I really Could do with some of that right now. I wasnt asked about paying the deposit when I checked in, when I went for dinner in one of the restaurants and bear in mind that I had just arrived with about 10 minutes before the 10pm close time, the staff treated me like a criminal as I didnt go with a bank card or cash when i rushed for something to eat. Could have been handled better, I just checked in and paid for a couple of days so even if I ran away next day surely I would be the one losing the money I just paid in advance, I was tired and I had to go back to the room to get the purse to pay this when it should have just gone on the room."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Great hotel in general, albeit being far from the center. Super nice room with an amazing bathroom, superb pool with great views.  The staff is not always helpful or too caring. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Confortable room. Nice pool and garden on roof top. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel specially the staff at the tides restaurant are very friendly and welcoming we really want to thank the following staff Thiwanka, Nadeesha, Rajiv, manoj, salinda, Raveen and Gayoma. We wish them all the best ! The hotel maintained a good security system and made the guest feel safe and secure we hope and pray that things will get better soon!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Staff we're very welcoming. We arrived at the hotel 3 hours prior to check in time and they we're able to get our room available really quickly. The pool is amazing with a view! and the rooms we're really nice. The corridor to walk to our room smelt of cigarettes the whole day which was off putting for non-smokers/kids. The hotel taxi we booked to catch our train did not have AC.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Unfortunately we were there during the week the awful Easter Sunday bombings happened, so spent the majority of the time in the hotel, which had amazing faculties such as the pool to keep people occupied and happy. Due to the sad events, the hotel was a lot quieter than expected so some of the buffets were made smaller for breakfast and completely cancelled for dinner which was a shame."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"The rooftop pool is what makes this hotel. The breakfast buffet is delicious too with great variety. The rooms very spacious and comfortable.  We arrived at 5am because of our flight. I had already contacted pre arrival to see if I could organise early check in (was happy to pay extra) but was told they couldn’t say until the day. Upon arrival we were told no rooms were available and we had to wait until 10am (5 hours..!!!!!) and weren’t offered a drink, or any suggestions of what we could do to kill time that early in the morning, only ushered to the closed cafe seating in the corner where lots of other people were sleeping as they were being forced to wait in the lobby!!!! After several hours asleep (we were so tired and jet lagged) we kept asking when we could check in... eventually they said they could upgrade our room. This was about 4 hours after we arrived. Ridiculous!! "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff is very friendly, speak English always offering their help to you regarding all issues. I had to print one contract, they did it at the reception. The bed was very comfortable. Large swimming pool is particularly pleasing after a hot day of touring (we loved it). Very good food at the restaurant. You can get a 10 percent discount at Matino Mall if you say you live in a hotel. Our flight was very late in the evening, so we were allowed to stay in the pool area all day long until late at night. I can't say anything wrong. This is a luxury hotel and I really recommend it."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,It's a bit overpriced
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"This hotel is an absolute pleasure to stay at. The room was large, clean, quiet. Pretty much brand new. The balcony was great to watch the ocean or storms come in. The rooftop infinity pool was amazing. The gym would have to be the best hotel gym that I have ever seen. Buffet breakfast was amazing with every possible option. Staff were polite and helpful and so friendly. It’s a piece of paradise to retreat to after being in the city. Hallways on the room level constantly smelled like cigarette smoke. Not a massive issue but probably the only negative thing I could say "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Very polite, friendly and helpful staff. A beautiful hotel, more than comfortable and great for a short stay at the end of our trip to this fab country!"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I arrived at a difficult time. Not only late in the evening but a day after the bombings in Colombo.
There were quality security checks at entry which was actually comforting.
Hotel staff were very friendly and professional.
The pool and rooftop in general are spectacular."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Staff were very friendly and approachable.
Restaurants were very modern and showcased a variety of choices.
Roof top Garden/pool was excellent and kept immaculately clean. House keeping  was always late to clean the rooms, when asked for replenishments the items were never given.
Promised items were not delievered. Staff had no clue about printing facilities.
Price was a bit high."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"All the staff were so so pleasant and helpful even in the difficult situation that Colombo finds itself. The hotel was everything you expect from a 5 star hotel.

I assumed the hotel was beach front as per the photos, but it was fine."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The positive attitude of all staff in a very difficult time in Sri Lanka. A notice should be placed on lifts informing users to have their room key handy.  Without presenting the key to the reader  in the lift, it was going nowhere."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We had the best time. This is hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed at, and best experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We had a fabulous time.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Room Service was Excellent, and the food was tasty and very well presented. The step out of the Bathroom was hardly visible there was no colour contrast and could get you to stub your toes.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Nice bathroom have in the room Balcony
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Had a wonderful stay in a room that has a full view of the ocean. Roof top infinity pool and garden serenity  off sets the hustle and bustle of city below.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff very accommodating, bathrooms have jacuzzi tubs, infinity pool on roof is unreal, restaurants are g reat and very reasonable for how nice the property is. You really never need to leave, but easy tuk tuk to Dutch Hospital district with more bars and restaurants etc. Would she been nicer to be able to jtt directly charge card on file for food, drinks etc. vs. needs to put down a desposit, but not a big deal"

Only hotel of this scale in Sri Lanka that I've come across that you can't charge to your room and settle at check out if you have a debit card. Rather inconvenient having to carry cash or card all around hotel including pool bar."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Just about everything To much security when arriving, but what to do"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. There was heightened security at the time due to recent events in Sri Lanka and the hotel did a really excellent job at putting our minds at ease and making us feel safe and secure. The staff were all extremely professional and did their jobs very well. The pool was lovely and all the food we ate was great. The gym facility had everything needed and we really enjoyed our stay here.  The pillows in the rooms were probably the worst pillows I’ve ever tried to sleep with, far too soft, I ended up using a small blow up travel pillow I had with me as I just could not sleep, both me and my partner had very poor sleep due to the pillows.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The property was immaculate. It looks even better in person. Definitely a 5-star feel that meets western hospitality standards. The staff went above and beyond to be helpful. Gorgeous roof top pool. Also— DEFINITELY book with breakfast included. They have a gigantic, delicious and fresh breakfast buffet. It was a tremendous stay. Nothing!!"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Security was excellent hospitality excellent everyone going the extra mile. The whole property is done to a very high standard. The infinity pool in the roof is a highlight quite spectacular. There is a bar and restaurants in the pool area aswell. Rooms are all large with bath tub and all are really nice. There is an underground car park and it’s ideally located and right opposite the Indian Ocean.  Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff are greatly trained and very attractive at all time in all locations.  Variety of food items at the breakfast buffet was great. Love the outside table with sea breeze. Beer garden at the roof top is fabulous. Really enjoyed the pool and steam room. Basically not a single negative point. Nothing"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Location & swimming pool
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Basically I liked everything about Marino Beach!
From the moment you enter you get that secure feeling as their security system is really good!
The rooms and the services were on top level , the pool is just amazing  and you would spend hours there!!
The gym is also well equipped .
the roof top restaurant and the room service were on point and they provide you a really good service.
I will definitely come there again to relax my weekends !!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Very good breakfast, beautiful place, very nice personal, and amazing hotel :)"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"From the moment we entered, we were amazed. The smell. The music. The people. Service was outstanding, rooms was fabulous we loved it with big bed and balcony, and nice bathroom. I really liked the shower gel and shampoo. We had order the room service several times and it’s was great! Service and presentation. Super. Only few things, orange it is must every where as part of the breakfast. And it’s was sad to know that you can order that together with set menu for breakfast. Other thing was if you are anyway paying the money could be a bit flexible in ordering omelette after 11 am. But this is the rules I understand. No issues. 
Also we book for 3 person however there extra bed was not ready for our arrival, but Houskeeping team fixed very quickly. Thank you guys! And here I want to say special THANK YOU to D.Rosheen Krikenberk, another we came back to room and my boys gave me a big surprise with assistance of Rosheen. A bath with rose petals, and bed decoration with flowers, and bottle of Moët. It’s was my second visit to Sri Lanka but the most unforgettable. ❤️"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,it was great to stay there for even a day. we were both soo happy and enjoyed our day at your premises. the only thing i disagree with your services is we couldn't order some food stuff for us with dine in service to the room. if it was available everything will be great
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I booked this hotel after seeing the photo of the infinity pool. It lived up to expectations. I flew in from london that morning and my plan was to lie around all day in recovery. This i did with intervals in the garden bar and later in the sunset bar. Loved the cocktails in that bar. They upgraded my room which was really nice. All the hotel staff were fabulous. Very modern and clean facilities. Simply cannot fault the hotel or the staff. Shall stay on my return to Colombo too. This time i may even leave the hotel. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I like the pool area its too huge and very comfortable,the view is awesome. Love the concept in roof top area.Premium room is too comfortable to stay,cleanliness is more than great.Lobby area is very wide and convenient also has accessible to mall area. A total of fantastic hotel.Also very generous due to complementary inside the room,i paid enough and they provide more than enough. Thank you so much marino beach hotel and expect me again when i get chance to visit again sri lanka. I dont have any comment,maybe what i could advice is to put some amenities in the lobby area to make it not too empty."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,There was no hair blower provided in the washroom as it is a basic feature in most star hotels
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"nice breakfast selection, good quality, spacious facility had an incident when I took the dinner buffet: I was mentioned a certain price but when checking out - price charged was much higher. I guess that was a misunderstanding that unnecessarily has irritated me. a simple poster at the entrance of the restaurant stating the buffet price would have avoided the incident"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"High security, good food. Location  First Two days room was very clean and smells good 
But on 3rd day room was not well cleaned & laundry service was not good, all other things went perfect 
Thank you for taking care of us 
I will be back very soon"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The staff are utterly delightful. Thank you. Nothing was too much trouble  Bit of noise coming off nearby construction but that's no fault of the hotel... Just something to keep in mind
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Cleanliness, pool and gym facilities, bar and restaurant  Nothing "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Staff quite excellent. Security check helped to enhance confidence of safety. Restaurant staff also excellent. Choice of foods are fabulous. Loation and enviorenment mind blowing. Infinity pool with surrounding are quite and relaxing. Television in the room.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Nothing  Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"After lot of (re) search, I booked this hotel for the lovely view it has got from the roof top pool. The hotel is 30 km drive from the airport and I reached in 40 mins. The hotel staff were so good, they gave me an early check in and I really appreciate that. The rooms are exquisite and offered a good view of the sea. I came for a break and I spent good time in the pool. Breakfast was above my expectations, nice collections of dishes. I found my favourite Iceland Bread here, that made me feel so good. They got Coconut water as part of the juices which was something I found awesome. It was an excellent stay overall. The place has a mall inside the hotel and also you can access the road side quickly for any eatery stuff. There is super market like Seven11 and some good small restaurants."

Cleanliness
Great staff

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Staff extremely nice and helpful always. Only once the driver asked for some money extra that wasn't in the bills request, Room big and nice, really easy access to the restaurant at the top floor with the best Chinese restaurant ever tried. Really beautiful infinity swimming pool with Jacuzzi and garden!  Easy access to the mall. Good stay at Marino beach hotel! If we have to come back for sire we will back here. Thank you We asked for some water calling 3 times the reception. We didn't get it at the end."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Breakfast was perfect and the dinner also. Nice view from swimming pool. The staff was very friendly. Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"breakfast was not the greatest, and service at breakfast was slow. location was great specifically asked for king bed and acknowledged by hotel too, but given twin beds. And they wouldnt shift me on night 2 either - saying no king bed rooms available."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel is quite new and nice, location is very convenient. The pool is just stunning and view is amazing! Staff was very friendly and provided a good service. Highly recommended! I’d come back with the great pleasure."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Spacious Rooms & Bath rooms, F&B staff were fabulous. The male & female waiters were very friendly & helpful including the black colour uniformed female restaurant hosts.  Overall the hotel was great and I extended my stay for additional 5 room nights. Great shopping Mall within the hotel premises. Several Speciality Food outlets serving dishes for customer from all corners of the world. Check in was very poor. I got the rooms 14:55 while I specifically requested room for 13:30. Internet wasn't the best. Never saw the black color uniformed male restaurant hosts much of a help or with a smile ever. The waiter at the bar on the 10th floor during one night spend most of his time chatting with a Sri Lanka couple, ignoring my family thought we called him. Need closer supervision late hours."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The hotel was really lovely. Very clean. Very lavish. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great ammenities and little extras in the room. 
The buffet breakfast was one of the best I’ve ever experienced in all my years of travel. We even had buffet dinner there too and it was exceptional. 
Highly recommend. This is worth a splurge for a few nights luxury accommodation. "

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Room and the view was amazing. Staff were also helpful and welcoming. 
 Rooms are not fully soundproof and also it was very hard to close and open balcony door. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"In general the rooms are comfortable and the Rooftop has a stunning view.  1. We often get chased at 10pm at the Rooftop even though we spent lots of money and entertainment.
2. I find it really hard to understand why you charge 100 Rupees for sauce when we are spending money at your premises.
3. No flexibility exercised by the employees.
4. I had a client that came looking for me and he told me that he finds it hard to believe the lady at the Lobby does not know me when he mentioned my name. No guest recognition at all. I stayed for 6 nights.
5. Breakfast was average in terms of the taste. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Cleanliness, Location, Mall, spacious rooms.  One touch call service not quick as expected, but it doesn't matter rest all were excellent. "

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,All the facilities were upto date. The staff were incredibly friendly and made our stay as comfortable as we expected it to be Construction sites all around the building. Hopefully it would be very good once done. The doors were not closing fully and needed a bit of push from us to stop the alarm. The room service was slightly slow at times

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff, room and services are impeccable. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Very good hotel specially infinity pool area , excellent stay , But staff need to learn attitude and behaviours . Apart from that hotel was more than 5 star 🌟 level . Staff and their treatments , poor behaviours . Not suited for 5 star hotels , they should be trained well ."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It was really value for money, nice location, staff at reception were very helpful, will surely suggest my friends and relatives It took around 1.30 hrs to deliver the food we ordered for dinner"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"My husband loved the swimming pool and the surrounding facilities.  We loved the variety of food at breakfast and the buffet dinner and also the quality of the food.  The location was good with the sea views and breezes and a short tuk tuk ride to the Old Hospital and other tourist areas. The adjoining Mall for shopping (limited) was good.   The staff were very attentive.  The beds were very comfortable, as was the room I felt that the question about whether or not we had paid a deposit was tedious, every time we booked a drink etc. to our room.  I can't recall another hotel doing this."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Very friendly staff, very nice pool, good room service! Nothing"

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Beautiful location. Specially the rooftop infinity pool area. Rooms were comfy. Had to call several times to get services. May be in need of more staff.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"We‘d booked this hotel for our first 3 days in Sri Lanka. It was the perfect place to get some rest after the long flight. Everything was there: nice rooms, a beautiful pool, a good gym and delicious food. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. Relatively speaking, this hotel is more expensive but it was definitely worth it. The location is ok as well, you can get everywhere in 10-20 minutes with a tuk-tuk.  Nothing really, only the cocktails in the garden bar could have been better. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"A very nice hotel, well equipped with decent size rooms. Very welcoming personnel, helpful and smiling all the time. Even though this is not a typical 5-star hotel by European standards, I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. Rooftop bar closes at 11:00 PM. The same with the lobby bar. So, not much to do after 11 PM :)"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Amazing breakfast. Very nice rooftop pool/garden area. Having to queue to check in. Took around 30 minutes to complete check in process.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Friendly and always very helpful staff. Nice location directly at the sea. Awesome room which had a balcony with a sea view. Breakfast buffet and the rooftop bar with the infinity pool were amazing as well.
Quick journey to Colombo Fort station by Tuk-Tuk etc.
Absolutely nothing to complain about. Highly recommended for one night after arrival as we did as well as for long-term stays."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything TV volume was not working
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great location, Nice facilities, Awesome food and Friendly staff. I’m definitely recommending this hotel to everyone. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The bed was so comfortable and it felt like home.. the buffet had so much variety and i liked it very much.The Marino shopping mall within the hotel gives a vide variety of shopping experience. The second day, the shower gel, shampoo and lotion were not replaced. However they did on the third day. But overall it was a good experience"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great location, close to everything, Seaview room was fantastic. Infinity pool, rooftop bar, spa and all the facilities were awesome. Special thanks to Supun at the reception for the friendly and fabulous customer service, which made me want to stay in the hotel and also to chef Ayesh in the kitchen who went extra lengths in order to get me some “Milk Rice”, which was not available for the morning buffet on the day. Friendly staff and great service. A+"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Pretty much most of the things Balcony not safety enough for(young kids)it’s not up to the standards

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Location, Staff, and Room Breakfast buffet wasn't the best. I only had sri lankan food but the food wasn't fresh. I didn't place a deposit when im checking in so I had to pay every time I order something.  Inconvenient."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything about the property is nice, with state of the art facilities, amazing indeed! Wish to stay longer. Will be back soon!  None"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Roof top pool was the star. Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone as a wonderful stay in Colombo. We needed a place to recover after almost 11 hours of flight before our 3 weeks adventure in SriLanka and we did find an oasis of relaxation. The upfloor pool,bar and spa are beautiful. We couldn't get enough of them. The breakfast is various with plenty of tasty choices. Tuk tuk will drive you anywhere at a 2-300 rupees. Take the ones with taxi meter on! Pettah floating market, Gangaramaya Temple and many more!As a tip, if you want to eat excellent local food in Colombo, across the street from McDonads which is very near the hotel, there is a small, very small tavern. You will see in the windows a counterdeck with round claypots full of stews/curries. The place is cheap~230-280 rupees the most expensive dish but the food is to die for! Try it but be sure to do it before 15:00! Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,This is one of my best stays. The restaurant staff were extremely friendly. You must try this hotel.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It is a nice hotel with a beautiful infinity pool. Staff were very attentive and friendly, the beds were comfy, balcony with view, very clean room and the bathroom. Location was good but it is not next to the ""beach"" but next to the sea. A shopping mall on the ground floor. Everything was great but if management reading this review, I like to know why this booking shows as cancelled on booking.com. I think this is causing a problem with my membership & discount. Security checking is a bit OTT."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"An impeccably trained and friendly staff, attention to detail in every corner, security, access, amenities, and so much more. This place was an absolute value and one of the best places I have stayed in. Elegant design and lots to do at the hotel itself. Also an incredible gym, rooftop garden, and dining. 100% satisfied!"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"POOL, LOCATION, SERVICES, HOUSE KEEPING, RESTAURANTS.  CHECK IN TAKES LOTS OF TIME, EVEN THOUGH FEW PEOPLE ARE THERE. OTHERWISE OK. HOTEL IS CHARGES ₹ 15500/ PER DAY, ITS OK BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE STEAM YOU HAVE TO PAY ₹120/ . I DON'T UNDERSTAND IN SUCH A NICE PROPERTY WHERE CUSTOMER PAYING SUBSTANTIAL ROOM CHARGE WHY HOTEL COLLECT SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT. ITS LOOK BAD."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"This hotel deserves the five stars which it has and it can be compared almost to all European five stars hotel! Everything was perfect and I can just recommend this hotel to everyone. Spacious rooms, amazing facilities, friendly staff, tasty breakfast, and perfect location to explore Colombo. The services in the SPA center are overpriced and the threes on the rooftop of the building (infinity pool and jacuzzi), especially the Araliya trees are sick (with Anoplophora glabripennis bugs). I got a lot of bites one afternoon and my skin was irritated."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The pool is lovely and staff were very helpful. The room was modern and clean. Nothing!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Atmosphere  ' silence ' and rate of this hotel is so much good and they  had gratified of this place and wonderful swimming pool at the top and it also proper gym saloon This hotel has not very good lobby in comparison to the other hotel in Colombo

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I’ve liked everything. The staff was really polite and helpful. Breakfast is very good, you have everything you can imagine. The garden and the beautiful swimming pool on the roof are marvelous. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The only thing I might complain is about the AC to me it was super cold at the lobby and restaurants."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The location with the great sea view, the rooms are big, comfortable and well designed.Amazing bathrooms with both a bath tub and a shower.The pool and garden bar makes it perfect for a great relaxing afternoon. The bed sheets could've been a bit smoother."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The staff were very service minded. The hotel is beautiful and very clean
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great facilities, friendly staff, clean and modern rooms. Location was good with lots of local shops and restaurants just up the road.  Out of Marino's control, but there was a lot of construction and run down buildings directly outside our balcony, so it didn't make for an appealing view, we still had a view of the sea so that made up for it! :) "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very clean

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The swimming pool and gym are great, though didnt have the chance to use the swimming pool due to the weather The bar and restaurants in the hotel close by 10Pm which i think its a bit early to be closed"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Our last hotel in Sri Lanka before we went home we luckily did chose Marino Beach Colombo. Hotel with extremely nice swimming pool overlooking the city and the sea on the 10th floor. We had 2 rooms, unfortunately not adjoining, although we thought there was opportunity for it. The rooms were neat, clean and the beds were lovely soft. Breakfast buffet one of the best on our 3 week long trip in Sri Lanka. We had dinner at the restaurant and they served a large and delicious selection of buffet. If you are going to Colombo you only need ½ day, then you have seen the city."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Rest everything  Deposit that was charged ....
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Fabulous hotel with good service and the staff so helpful 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Theres nothing to dislike about this hotel, the staff are friendly the food is amazing, the rooms are perfect and the swimming pool is just breathtaking!

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Infinity pool was superb....All restaurants had courteous staff and food was fresh and great....Buffet breakfast was excellent...Well trained and happy staff Transportation was a bit expensive. Should provide complimentary airport transfers for long stay clients."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Mall, Pool, Steam room and room facilities are excellent. At the parking lot clarity of arrows/guides are bit chaotic."

The room has all the facilities that you could ask for and the washroom is very clean and modern.  The hospitality of the staff is outstanding and willing to help you with anything.  The manager of Marino Beach Colombo, Ramsheed has been incredible in terms of arranging the travel with the hotel facilities and made us feel like being home.  The trips arranged by the Hotel were excellent and the guides and drivers are very knowledgeable and friendly.  The mall in the same facility is the biggest plus with high-quality merchandise with reasonable price and 10% discount to Marino Beach's guests."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The breakfast was excellent, very good selection of food could select. Sri lankan hoppers was my favourite.The english breakfast was the Tea I had it Sri lanka. I like to go there again some time next year only to have delicious  tea. I must say that my payment for the hotel was mishandle. I paid full amount for 16 nights on arrival 15 July.But I found out it was not the case. They been deducting every day according to the exchange rate. I neverhad this problem in other hotels that I have been staying in Sri Lanka. Topaz and Oso charged only once."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  The rood garden pool was superb. The location was not the best in Colombo.  Too much building work going on around.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything about this hotel was amazing the room the pool the restaurants and especially the staff A few minor things they need to have the same  products available at all of the restaurants for example Coke Zero one or two of the facilities sold it but not all they also need a small table on the balcony they also need to check up on the exterior maintenance
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Great start to Sri Lanka holiday. Great room and perfect location in Colombo to get around Expensive alcohol and food
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The hotel is wonderfull. Didn’t like the city that much.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,The most beautiful things is no carpet in rooms. This is the reason I chose this hotel. Because normally carpets are not so hygienic and smells as well. It is better if this hotel removes carpets from corridors.  They do not have photocopy machine and i could not print out any documents in reception.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Not much more to say than that the hotel had friendly staff, was in a reasonable location and had nice / comfortable rooms. Pool facilities were good albeit the water looked a bit on the cloudy side."

marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Comfortable bed, great breakfast spread and ease of check in. We opted to stay here for the second time cause of its location and proximity to other places like shopping malls and restaurants. More than anything its the view from the room which got us right back. This is our second time at Marino Beach and its quite evident that the quality has detiororated. The floors were not clean and the furniture was covered in dust in places that were not in plain sight, which wasn't the case the last time we were there. The overall attitude of the staff is way lower than last time and greetings and acknowledgements were hard to come by "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The rooftop pool, jacuzzi sand bar are fantastic! The staff are incredible and make you feel so welcome and make sure that you want for nothing! Security is top notch!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The stuff was helpful especially (Chalani Peirisv) in the reception
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Simply Everything. From the time of check in till the time of check out everything was well maintained by the staff, and my entire experience was simply amazing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"fantastic , Superb Service . Friendly Staff , Very Clean Nothing"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Centrally located in Colombo with lots of good shopping and restaurant within easy walking distance, and all major sites are a short tuk-tuk or taxi ride away. I also appreciated the great sea views from my room as well as the excellent roof top pool. While staff were professional I didn’t find they were as courteous or client service oriented as I would have expected from a hotel at this price point."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"hotel really was superb and the staff truly humbling in their warmth, I tried not to eat too much of the scrumptious   breakfast, but any excuse  to sit on the beach veranda...Best wishes to Roshan the pianist  who was the night to a busy holiday!tony and sue from croydon Glass doors that I was prone too bump into Bathroom."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,The rooftop setting was truly innovative and interesting. The layout and design of the infinity pool - the sunsets and the garden was truly the highlight of this fairly new hotel. The dilapidated buildings on either side of the property. The building constructions site was too noisy. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The pool is awesome. The rooms are very good too. We were having a wonderful time at this hotel till they decided to mess it up with a cheap hospitality practice.It was 9 am and we just finished breakfast and got into the lift. We suddenly found that our access cards were not working. The lift doors were closed and we can't operate any button without the card working. Not even the door opens. We had to wait till someone opened the door. We reached the 10th floor and asked one of the staff to help us. The staff thought it's a problem with the lift card reader and used his card to send us to our correct floor - the 3rd floor.When we reached our room, we found the card not working again. Thinking the card has failed, we called the staff to open the room for us - one of us had to use the bathroom urgently. None of the staff was willing to open the door. Finally one of the staff said: 'Oh you are checking out today is it?'. We said check out is 12 noon. No assistance to get us into the room. They told me to goto the lobby to get a new card and I pointed out to them to them - how am I supposed to use the lift! When they saw that I was getting angry by now, one of the staff offered to get us a new card.10 mins later, a new card arrived - a single card. Thus me and my wife can't move around independently in the hotel. This hotel needs to be called out for this practice. This is a tactic used to get guests to check out early. I am from the travel industry and will never give business again to a hotel that indulges in this cheap tactic. Regardless of how good the facilities of the hotel are, service is pathetic if they do this."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Perfect stay in the heart of Colombo. Top Roof Pool. Rooms are fantastic! Very good location! Staff is very friendly and ready to help!

marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The hotel staff are so helpful. The room was fine, clean and had a great shower. The breakfast buffet was fabulous. The rooftop pool was a little disappointing. The photos are taken from a very strategic angle. I’m not sure how they’ve eliminated the building works almost surrounding the whole area.  It was also very overcast when we stayed so it was not as picturesque as expected. We thought it was a bit overpriced."

marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,Facilities in the hotel were very nice and Mr Ramsheed took excellent care of us. I am very satisfied with the overall experience from the hotel. Also Suranga who drove us from Colombo to Kandy is a gentleman and a true professional. Breakfast was extensive with very good customer service in the Restaurant. The check in experience was a nightmare.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Roof top pool and the room decor.
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,The staff smile and respect were so special The buffet was amazing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.5 ,"Marino Beach Colombo hotel was exactly as I anticipated: comparing to other hotels in this district it was much more decent, good-looking and way more luxury. The room and other hotel premises were very clean, without any surprises like lack of hot water or huge bugs on the wall; the breakfast was also very good, with wide range of pastry, fresh fruits and main meals like fried eggs and differen types of Asian food.And, of course I was very impressed with the view and with the wimming pool on the roof! Marino Beach Colombo is a decent hotel with high quality service, but it is not the main reason why you should stay at this hotel - the main reason is great swimming pool & garden located on the rooftop! It was great! Everything was great, can't remember any bad experiense."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I like the hotel room view. And the rooms service facility at  one call they were on my door which is very rear.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Room was clean.. friendly staff.. front desk was really good. Fiona was the one who helped me at the desk and she helped alot with all my request. Thumbs up for that. Didnt have time to check the rooftop garden.. I'm sure it's nice. Picture of the room are as advertised in the site.. the bath tub is a rectangle not a square just incase anyone was fooled Probably should extend the pool usage time passing the check out time. Atleast till 5pm of the check out date. Air conditioning was really annoying to control. Remote access would be more preferable rather than having to stand up to control it, cause it didnt change to the temperature I wanted it to be at. Most of the time I just ended up switching it off after being frozen.  The hotel helped me fix it once but ofcourse I removed the key card to go out and come back and I was at square one again. Mini bar was abit of let down even though it was free. Two carbonated drinks and a fruit juice. That's it "

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Location, roof top and cleanliness "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The beach view from the room was partial but the comfort of rooms and infinity swimming pool on the rooftop of the hotel summed it up. The Marino beach hotel in Colombo is definitely value for money!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The pool at the roof was elegant. Connection to the mall. Connected balconies create a safety and privacy gap if you forgot to close your door and curtains.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Hotel felt really safe and they have amazing in-room dining. Staff forgot to send the luggage to the room even after we called them.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Value for money.  Excellent location. Staffs are friendly. Infinitive pool is the highlight.  Floorz pub is something I never expected to be that catchy with colourful lightings.. especially the greeny entrance.  Comfortable and spacious room.  Room service menus are reasonable for this standard.. Overall a perfect 5 star richness place to experience. There are no proper information about the restaurant timings in the roof top.  Do they serve coffee?  No idea.

The bathroom was spacious too, and a nice touch was the bathtub. 
The property is attached to a mall and reasonably well located with respect to restaurants and cafes.  Service from the reception was a bit slow. For example in spite of calling thrice no one showed up to take our bags and eventually we took them ourselves. But that could be attributed to how full the hotel was. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The hotel's 10th floor viewing deck is awesome..gives a breathtaking view of sea and passing train. The rooms are also v well maintained. The food is not so good at the restaurant nor is breakfast something extra ordinary. These could be improved

Last few nights stay on our holiday so decided to treat ourselves and weren’t disappointed. Lovely high tea. The only one thing was the swipe cards didn’t always work in the elevators. The females of our group loved the Mall attached to the hotel - great for last minute shopping.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The staff welcomed me as if I was family and cared for me the entire time I stayed at the hotel, advising me the of possible pitfalls of the local area.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Good
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"We got offered triple upgrade and the room was amazing. This is my fifth time here in less than two months. When we were in the room someone started knocking on the door.

Good intentions but uncomfortable how he suddenly opened the door."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We booked Marino Beach twice during our stay in Sri-Lanka. Both times the rooms were clean, spacious, comfy and had a beautiful view of the ocean.  The rooftop pool was so relaxing, with great views of the ocean and city. The staff were really friendly and assisted with anything needed, it was also great that they had a night time menu from 11pm to 6am - although the menu options were limited it was a great option to have on late nights. The rooms and the hotel itself truly feel luxurious, and well worth the price paid for the stay."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great hotel, really good facilities and lovely staff, would definitely recommend."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Marino Beach had the best location with everything being in close reach. The infinity pool was the best for the children as the spent the majority of their time there. The breakfast restaurant staff were excellent as well as the buffet being absolutely delicious with a huge variety of options. A special mention to the hoppers chef ayesh who was the sweetest person we’ve ever met!  The waiters during breakfast (Malaka, Waruna, Hilmi and Chandima) were very respectful and nice. Excellent service from Dawood (front office daytime manager) at the front office and Dinush (night time manager) as they were very helpful and provided an excellent service. Maduka was also very good at the reception. We stayed for a long time, so there were different room service staff but they were all very well mannered. If we come to stay in Colombo, we will definitely stay here again! The front office female staff were very uptight, big headed and unprofessional (they didn’t treat all guests equally from our point of view as we stayed for a very long time at the hotel). One or two male receptionists were a little rude, especially on the first day of arrival the bell desk staff Budika was very impolite and disrespectful. Until we left the hotel he always looked at us very rudely with a lot of attitude and didn’t bother to cooperate with us when we were asking for some help with the check in as we were standing there for more than half an hour. Apart from him and the female staff, the rest of the staff in the hotel were good. Also, on our first day we had a AC leakage from the ceiling in the in the middle of the night, causing a lot of water on the floor. However manger Dinesh handled the situation very well and shifted us to a different room until the AC was fixed."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,A good location. From the room you will get a partial view of the sea and city. A very spacious room and large bathroom. The pool gives you a full view of the city and the sea. The room view was horrid although its not the fault of the hotel as it was the surrounding.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everyone at the hotel was very friendly. They scan your suitcase and handbags when you enter the hotel, like you see at the airport. The receptionist was very friendly and they took our suitcases to the hotel room as well. When you want to go to any guest floor, you need a hotel room card which is good if you are concerned about the safety with the mall next door to the hotel. Just a note that the elevator in the mall does not get you to the hotel rooms at all and they are separate lifts. 
The beds are like clouds, they are so comfy you don't want to get up and you sleep like a baby. The hotel room and bathroom were clean and they provided you with toothbrushes, shaving kit, vanity kit, shower caps, a loofah and shoe shining kit. Room service was easy and the food was great. The breakfast and dinner buffet were really nice. Lots of options to choose from. The fresh fruit was tasty. 
The pool area has a great view over the ocean and the rooftop area is very calming and relaxing. Definitely worth going up during the day and at night. It's difficult to find a reason not to like this hotel. I have noticed that when ordered drinks for breakfast or dinner it would take them at least 5-15 minutes before you would get it regardless of how busy it was. Not a big issue only a side note."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The rooms are clean and tidy and the breakfast was out of this world. Totally amazing place. Would stay again 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Everything  Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great hotel with plenty of facilities (very well equipped gym, beautiful pool area, hot tub, steam room) and several restaurants on site. We had breakfast buffet and a la carte dinner in the main restaurant, both great value and tasty. Helpful staff, clean and comfortable room .. we even had a complimentary upgrade!"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Good stay literally there is nothing wrong about the place. The staff is very friendly and someone who knows the business. House keeping and laundry is quick responsive.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The room was perfect, we could spend very comfortable time, also we love the pool very much. We ordered Sri lankan dishes by room service, and were very tasty. Also the bar in 8th floor was very nice atmosphere and service. Service level is below the 5 star. Maybe it's because of the busiest moment for the hotel. However, some staffs kindly helped us also, so maybe next time."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything.  Food wasn't great
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Good pool and gym  Not a lot of atmosphere in the bar
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Well-appointed room, excellent facilities in the hotel, well-trained and friendly staff. The rooftop area is fantastic and was not overcrowded at all, which I had feared from reading other reviews. I was apprehensive about the check-in process because of what I'd read in some other reviews, and it did take one hour from walking into the lobby to walking into the room. Ramsheed in their front office explained the circumstances and made us feel at ease.Additionally, we were placed in smoking room without ever being asked. We are both non-smokers. The smell was only noticeable upon entering the room and wasn't bad enough to bother requesting a room change though."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Top Job von Fiona an der Rezeption bzgl. Late Check Out
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The hotel itself and the service was exelent!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything!!! The cocktail next to the pool was something incredible. Staff was really helpful. View is amazing. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"The quality of service is brilliant, the staff were  attentive and helpful with anything you needed. Very comfortable rooms, and a lovely infinity pool. The Ocean Grill restaurant was really good.  The hotel is modern and very clean, but it’s not as luxurious or detail focussed as a lot of other 5* hotels. The ‘Tides Restaurant’ buffet option again isn’t what you can get at other 5* hotels despite being pretty decent. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Rooftop pool, size of the deluxe room, hotel location.  The staff at the reception can be more smiling and courteous. The guy who checked us in had absolutely no smile and courtesy. The room which we got had a connecting door to the next room so we could hear people partying and making noises in the middle of the night.  "
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,monipuolinen ja runsas ja hyvää  tervellinen Sounds from the disco coming to the room
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"nice location, nice restaurant, nice swimming pool and friendly staff  It's very nicely located hotel,clean and tidy "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Excellent breakfast spread, but needed more variety since we were there for 11 nights. With respect to the hotel, it is a superb property with amazing view, However I must say that the service was not great. there were times when we had to call housekeeping 4-5 times to get one job done. They are very very slow when the hotel is at full capacity which shows they are not prepared. Also, front desk reception is not friendly at all, their first answer to any request is NO, which is very unprofessional and not expected of a hotel of this reputation. However would like to make a special mention of Julien, he was very helpful towards us, however the same is expected of all the staff. Cleaning staff also are very inefficient. Overall a great place/location to stay but very tired of POOR service."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Extremely neat and most importantly the staffs are very friendly...strongly recommend 👍
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Excellent hotel with a gorgeous roof top pool area. The gym facilities were also much better than they looked in the photos. Breakfast was really good too. We just stayed one night but it was percect.  The hair dryer barely worked but as we only had one night i just made do without. I'm sure they would have replaced it if i called reception. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"What a great stay. If you want to indulge yourself, you have to be here. The staff is amazing, friendly and patient. They have solutions and suggestions for everything. The scenery is breathtaking. The infinity pool. Breakfast. Fantastic. Nothing."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool, the jacuzzi, the view from the room It is a little bit annoying because right next to the hotel there is a construction site(another hotel is under construction) and if you open the balcony door you could hear the machines working, you can hear them work even if you stay at pool"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Rooftop garden and bar
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Lovely Hotel overlooking the seaview, all rooms face the sea.
Staff are very friendly and helpful Specially Ms. Fiona she guided me for good restaurants and other happening places near the hotel and in Hotel as well.
I had a Deluxe King room, room is too large, Room was very modern, all amenities.
Hotel premises are very nice, with great pool area and garden bar, Hotel is connected with Marina mall so you can go for shopping and chilling there is floatz bar as well with snooker pool table with very minimal rates
The Restaurant on sea face and the food is really amazing and lots of varieties, as I am vegetarian I found lot of options to feed myself.
Overall a nice hotel, and from this experience will book my another stays in future :) "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Roof top pool
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The pool and floatz pub excellent 💙❤️👍
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"Very nice rooms. Excellent pool and garden at the rooftop.  They have An obsession with security so going in and out of the parking and the hotel is un unpleasant situation. No much privacy, always controlling who is with you again for your security."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable and luxurious. Staff was beyond accommodating and friendly. I was greatful for such a nice bathroom with spacious bathtub....had a delightful soak after a very long travel day. I would highly recommend this hotel! The pool was a bit noisy with all of the neighboring construction but that is out of the hotel’s control. Very gorgeous scenery."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Beautiful facilities and lots of friendly staff. Check-in and -out are not quick and efficient. Though I stayed only 1 night, a $300 hold was put on my credit card for multiple days – up to 14, I was told."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,it was very near by our mosq .so easy to go and come back.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Its an almost brand new hotel opened only a year back. The hotel is a quality five star property. It's rooftop swimming pool and rooftop garden was simply amazing. The food in its Chinese restaurant was awesome. Buffet breakfast spread was very extensive and varied. Nothing to mention as far as the property is concerned except a few policy issues. (1) Customers with backpack should not be allowed into the restaurant considering what backpackers had done to three hotels in April. (2) Also male customers wearing sleeveless vests should not be allowed in the restaurant. It is uncomfortable to other guests and not hygienic when they are taking food in the buffet table and their underarm pit is exposed.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything is beautiful, clean and personal is extremely professional and friendly."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Lovely rooms, food good and helpful staff. Pool area very nice. Lots of monkeys around and nice grounds to walk. This hotel is good for a base when doing trips. The chef deserves a special mention as he is really helpful and caters to any dietary needs. Not much going on in the evenings."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The breakfast was excellent. I wish the breakfast was part of the room rate .  I had to pay for it separately ! Breakfast could be part of the room rate which was offered to me
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,They are providing drinking water only 2small (500ml) bottles per day if we want more the charges are 350/ bottle  which is too expensive.it  would have been a great if they provide  un limited drinking water.

2- at swimming pool shower and changing room is one floor down very risky must must consider to get on same floor "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The facilities, the cleanliness, the personal , everything was perfect. But when I booked the room, the price, at the beginning of the booking process, was not the same, as the price at the end of the booking process, which was higher, then the price that was expected. The price policy at the booking process should be exact."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very modern city hotel with great options for a family holiday as well..Infinity pool was amazing."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything has been considered in this hotel.  Our room was superb with ocean views from the balcony and excellent fixtures and fittings.  The pool area was simply fabulous and breakfast was very good with excellent coffee! I honestly cannot think of anything I disliked.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The person who did our check in was really kind and welcoming. The staff in the hotel has helped us from the beginning until the end of our stay. The location was really nice. We loved our breakfast it was a full buffet and it was really delicious. I'm really glad that my last night in Sri Lanka I've passed in this hotel. Hope to be back soon. And thank you for everything.

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Very nice hotel and spacious rooms and great food  Kinda noisy due to the size of the hotel 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Absolutely beautiful hotel. Room was huge with sea and city views. The roof has a huge infinity pool with towels provided, as well as a garden. Complimentary mini bar and car parking. Buffet dinner was good value with lots of choice. Breakfast cost extra"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Nice stay
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Hotel staff were great and made me feel very welcome. It was birthday when I was here and they delivered a cake to me which made me feel extra special. They went out their way to do this for me and I was most grateful. Facilities are exactly as advertised especially the infinity pool which is just stunning. Rooms extremely clean and staff very friendly. Loved my stay here - so much so that I ended up booking another week.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Staff were so friendly, made me feel at home. Nothing was too much trouble. Hotel is very clean and beds so comfortable. Infinity pool is just amazing and the viewing deck for sunset is stunning. Will definitely be back."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Good location, out of the main busy part of Colombo and near the sea and some good shops/restaurants. The rooftop pool is definitely the highlight. Rooms are also clean and comfortable, with an excellent tea selection!"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great breakfast, helpful staff and very accommodating to all requests. Everything was wonderful! Thank you!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"- Very new and swanky hotel with modern fixtures- Gym was very well equipped and staffed - best I've ever seen in a hotel! Trainer helped me with some great workouts- Lavish breakfast spread- Huge rooms- Courteous staff - Gorgeous views of the sea- Adorable security labs who always greet u with a wag - Non-veg & veg dishes were placed in the same container at breakfast and there was cross mixing. Despite telling the staff this was not changed for the 4 days that I stayed there.- Interconnecting doors between rooms dont have any safety chain - it didnt feel safe!- Interconnecting doors between rooms are not sound proof - I could hear the toilet flush and coughing- Request to change rooms was ignored by the reception - they never called me back!- Slow room service - had to call 4 times over 4 hours to get a knife and plate to cut some fruit"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Spacious and clean rooms with a balcony and great view. Large variety of food for breakfast. The hotel staff was very polite and helpful. The pool at the rooftop was amazing! The breakfast hall was very busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for hot beverages which were served to the table. There's no separate zone for kids, so sometimes it got very loud and the kids were splashing water at us while playing in the pool."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The view from the room was surreal !
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing value for money: the facilities and service I would expect from a place 3 times the price. A bright, airy, modern, clean, spacious hotel with an abundant supply of super-professional and friendly staff. I was here on business for 10 days, so have seen most aspects up close and personal. The rooftop rim-flow swimming pool with ocean vistas and accompanying garden are the highlights - even better in life than in the pictures, and open till late in the evening. Kudos to the gardeners: all is scrupulously tidy and every plant blooming and lush. That pool is pristine and sparkling. And big: at 53m, it's slightly bigger than Olympic standard and thus fantastic for my swim workouts. Likewise the gym, filled with the most modern and sturdy equipment. Then let me gush about breakfast: an impressive supply and variety on the buffet, with significant numbers of smiling staff ready to keep my coffee cup filled. Most evenings I was at my desk working and so used room service. The variety and quality of the food were very good, the food arrived hot and well presented, and the cost lower than expected. The room-cleaning staff deserve much credit: every part of the room is carefully cleaned and every tile and window gleams. The decor is light and white, and so any spec of dirt would show. Instead, it's all pristine and shiny. Just as on my previous stays - and in a previous review - I have found the financial admin and attitude frustrating: from full payment in advance to an excessive hold on your credit card if you'd like to charge items to your room. On this visit, I chose upon check-in not to permit that hold on my card, and so to forego the option of being able to bill to my room. This had unforeseen outcomes: for example, my laundry could not be simply left for me in my room and proved to be a bit of a fuss. But during the length of this stay, in which I've really seen the extent of the substantial investment in facilities and staff, my attitude has changed: the only way that this level of high value can be offered at these room rates is by alleviating all financial risks. The very frugality that initially left me seething (okay, I did check in at 3h00 in the morning after lengthy flight delays and lost baggage, so I was not at my best), I now see to be in my best interests: I get so much more than I paid for."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The view of the ocean from the hotel is amazing. The rooftop infinity pool is a wonderful experience. The breakfast buffet is expansive, and the food and drinks were reasonably priced for a star hotel. The hospitality of the service staff is excellent. Some quirks in the checkin process, but nothing significant to cause a bother."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The breakfast was the usual 5 star standards you come to expect. Sri Lankan omelet was top shelf. The infinity pool 🏊‍♀️ is stunning 50 m on the roof. Makes those laps fly by. Usual scam next door in the shopping mall - because the people are so friendly it’s hard to  work out the scammers. We stepped out of the mall looking for a super market for food items, to take home as gifts   were followed by a smart gent he calmed he worked at the mall!! Then the grooming starts 😁. Lucky I’m a big lad my wife is Petite and Asian, but I won’t mess with her. So he starts talking there is a super market up the road here - the green tuck tuck is the only one to get in as they are licensed! He has to go and meet his wife he busy  But this tuck tuck man will take us.. this all happens so fast - we get in and before we  know it he gets in too and says this is a special day to visit this temple we are passing, and it’s not busy ! I have google maps so I’m m not to concerned we haven gone far .  Is we are in the temple and he goes on and on !!! Not wanting to be rude, yet! Especially in a “religious “ place. I firmly but politely said we have to go to the supermarket now- and remember your off to meet you wife 😮 as we haven’t all day. So we leave he is still going in our general direction.... then we arrive at the so called super market and I let him have it !! This was the worst super market I have seen in the whole of Colombo. I knew it would be strangely. So I told him to take us back to the hotel - he got a bit shirty and tried to stop the tuck tuck fifty meters before the hotel, to shake us down. He gets out and leaves as he knew if I make a scene at the hotel, this was not in his plan !! I pay the tuck tuck man - enough to cover the tour ... morel of the story. Be polite but watch out for the scammers- had another young fellow stop me same day, saying do you speak English, I reply yes but keep walk-in in my direction!  If you want to talk - I’ve been robed in candy he starts to say, here we go again and advise him to go to his consulate- if the story was true,"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Nice clean rooms....infinity pool... The premium for the partial sea view is not worth it!
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Staff is friendly and place was  very clean 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Our stay was very brief at Marino Beach, but it is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The lobby area is quite stunning and makes a good impression as soon as you arrive. The room was immaculate and had everything we needed, including an iron which was rare as none of our previous hotels had one in the room. We arrived quite late for food and had the buffet which was satisfactory but not great. "

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Clean and comfortable room  Staffs are not much attentive to the guests
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I loved the pool and upper garden space! Absolutely gorgeous and inspiring. Also, Sri Lankans are some of the most kind, accommodating people I have ever met. I would stay at Marino Beach hotel again in a heart beat."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Room and facilities were amazing, delicious breakfast buffet with a great view but a little disappointed with their dinner buffet (which I don’t recommend). It took us a long time to check in as well as checking out. It seems that some of the staff at the reception area doesn’t know what to do. 
All other staff we’re friendly and very helpful."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Excellent service. Staff very friendly. Great facilities USD charge on visa. Yes it is reimbursed but not very convenient. Have to wait for reimbursement Would like more healthy eating options on menu"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff are very attentive and polite throughout the hotel.  We had an upper floor room close to the front of the hotel and had a great view over the sea and close by city.  The room is well appointed, clean and comfortable.  The infinity pool on the roof is fantastic and we had great views of sunsets from the pool. Overall we were very happy with our stay and it was a great place to finish our holiday in Sri Lanka. Highly recommended!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was very good but the pool was the best part. It was so big and has a great view. We asked to check out an hour later and they let us do that without any charge so we were very pleased about that too!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The rooftop infinity pool!!! Such an amazing spot with great views of the sea and the city. The garden bar was an absolute treat - I highly recommend their frozen cocktails! Rooms were luxurious, clean and comfortable. The gym was full of new equipment! All in all an amazing stay - you definitely get the luxury that you pay for."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Comfortable beds, rooms + tasteful breakfast"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,View was nice and reception staff  All was good 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The restaurant staff and staff on the desk were fantastic. The room is lovely and the location is great if you are interested in the history of Sri Lanka and the culture. I did not have a good experience after checking out however, that was because of one manager so I will not let it spoil all the other great things."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Great stylish relaxing hotel with wonderful staff.  The breakfast was amazing! Shame the room smelt of tobacco smoke though - no other negative comments.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,This hotel is amazing! Beautiful room (we were also upgraded which was a bonus!) with great facilities and extras such as complimentary snacks and soft drinks in the mini bar. We really enjoyed the roof top pool/jacuzzi - it is open until 10pm and gazing out at the lights across the city from the jacuzzi was really special. The rooftop bar serves great food and drinks and the cost is reasonable for a 5* hotel. The staff were very friendly and the check in/out process was quick and easy. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Roof top swimming pool
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"I loved the rooftop areas. I enjoyed lunch, drinks, and a few afternoons taking in the views. I would highly recommend an ocean front room. The train is not loud if that was a concern of yours. In fact, you cannot hear anything once the door is closed. Would love to go back !"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I liked the modern and luxury touches. Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything was great ... Everything I don't find something to mention here!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Hotel was amazing - everything you need under one roof including its own nightclub and mall. The price of food and drinks in the hotel was reasonable - no more than you’d get in a restaurant elsewhere so was pleased about that. The infinity pool was unbelievable. Get the sun all day and the sunsets from the viewing deck were incredible. I had the deluxe king room and stayed there for 10 nights - was spacious and had everything I needed included complimentary water and juice. A safe was also provided at no extra cost. Staff were so lovely and nothing was too much trouble. You can also get taxis from the hotel which again are reasonably priced although I tended to use uber after a couple of days as was cheaper and was getting used to the area etc. Would highly recommend this hotel and if I am ever back in Colombo I will definitely be staying here. My friends stayed close by for a couple of days and they were also really impressed with the hotel after the manager took time out to give us the full tour. It was also my birthday during my stay there and I was greeted with a beautiful birthday cake in the morning. It’s the small things like that that make the difference especially when you’re on your own. I have also recommended to all my friend’s and family. Thank you to everyone at Marino beach for contributing to my memorable stay in Sri Lanka.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Beautiful hotel with rooftop pool and jacuzzi, great buffet for breakfast and dinner with cery good choice of food"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Such an amazing experience in this hotel. I cannot even words to express the quality of customer service, facilities.
Thank you I liked everything."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The breakfast was par excellence, The staff at the Airport were hospitable friendly and very helpful.The rooms were clean, comfortable and the bouquet of the tea was an elegant touch.And the view from the infinity pool was an awesome experience.Keep up the good work and the high standards! Just a bit of constructive criticism: The bell boy could have been a bit more careful whilst handling the baggage, our soft shell bags were placed under another guests heavy hard shell baggage causing a bit of damage to some of the delicate articles we were carrying."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"-Room is spacious and looks modern, and facilities are good, satisfied with the washroom, which is reasonably designed.-Wifi speed was good.-Hotel staffs were friendly.-Got a tin of Dambra tea from the management as a gift, which was really a surprise. -Wished to be upgraded to a room with full sea view since I stayed there for 6 nights, but reception said need additional charge.-The public area of the room floors is carpeted, which makes it a little bit hard to move the luggage. Ground tile would be better. But this is not something unsatisfied."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. The pool area and gym were fantastic. The buffet breakfast also had a wide variety to suit all cultures. They provided housekeeping and fresh towels all day and unlimited water.  You could have cocktails by the pool but were unable to have food purchased from the same bar next to the pool at the pool or bring your own snacks.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Fabulous place to stay with great facilities and lovely staff  Watch walking around the pool as it gets very slippery. The wooden boards really need to be slip proofed as I fell down the stairs when they were wet
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Near to shopping mall and centrally located.  Room allotted was not as shown in picture 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The Ambience of the hotel. The size and cleanliness of the room. Excellent staff and service. The balcony door was difficult to open n close. We had to leave it open over night, which filled our room with mosquitoes. The bathroom door was a bit difficult to open n close as well. The beeding from obe of the washroom cubicles fell out. "

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Yes  All good 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The staff was super friendly. I stayed over my birthday and when I came back to my room there was a birthday cake waiting for me. Very nice. The view in the roof and infinity pool was fantastic. The only small thing is when on a lounger at the i I infinity pool they didn’t seem to be coming by and taking drink orders. I think that would’ve been nice but didn’t really ruin the experience
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"I liked the modern facilities. I also saw  the staff try their best to accommodate your requests. With slight effort they will fit into the excellent category. I did NOT find any difference between a superior and a deluxe room as I stayed in a superior room in January I was in an excellent position to judge between the deluxe this time! On check out they made a mess of the preauthorisation on my Visa and the receptionist assured me the USD 300 will be released to my account within a working week! On the day of check out, within about one hour, I was asked whether I am checking out at least five times! It was a nuisance!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,All everything other is wonderful... and stuff friendly and helpful.  Checking everytime even if you go 5 mins they are checking your bags and your buckets you and your family for nothing!!!!

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The infinity pool was incredible and the food and drink options were great. Also in a good location to access Colombo. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The location was good and easily accessible with the Marino mall just right there Few of the the staff at the front desk is not friendly at all. 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,Magnificent very large wet edge pool perfect if you like doing laps or generally just laying around looking out to sea. 'Large and comfortable room with good size tv. the world cup was on. Extensive breakfast choices ranging from local  healthy and western. The Evening buffet was good value and we thoroughly enjoyed a dinner at the Chinese Restaurant attached to the hotel. We Would recommend a stay here Our only complaint was that we had a load of washing done and it turned out to be the most expensive we had the whole 3 weeks in Sri Lanka. This was due to the added taxes which had not been mentioned anywhere not in the compendium or on the laundry sheet. I think that the Hotel needs to address this issue. We did mention it to reception when we checked out
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Beautiful hotel, excellent room and great facilities and service. Close to shopping and restaurants."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Overall nice experience this time... thank you so much Mr.Ramsheed and Mr.Sajeevan...

We enjoyed the buffet, shopped at the mall, loved the pool and drinks, room service was great and so was all of the staff in every aspect. The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to all and would definitely stay again when in Colombo. It's right next to the beach and everything else in between.  The only thing I can honestly complain about this place is that the jacuzzi wasn't warm enough. It was normal temperature as the pool. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Didn't eat breakfast Everything was good as usual
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Easy to  access. Center of the Colombo and lot of things to do.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The hotel itself : staff : Mall : None so far 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"The rooftop pool was great & wonderful view of the ocean. Far from the main area, tuk tuk’s trying to rip you off."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Great 5 star hotel all round. Staff the rooms, food and service was amazing. Everyone was so friendly the rooms were spotless and I must say the best water pressure for a shower I had during my trip. Infinity pool was insane with great service for excellent cocktails while watching the sunset from 10 floors up. To finish it of theres a shopping mall and a late night bar that has top notch music with flaming and smoking cocktails with an experienced staff. Great night and great stay"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"After such a bad experience booking into a hotel close by then booking into Marino for emergency, I wish we’d just booked here from the start. This hotel treated us like royalty. The staff were lovely and extremely helpful, they had everything you could possible need for your stay and topped you up with bottled water morning and evening. Thank you so much for the best hotel we stayed at in Sri Lanka and making us feel welcomed and safe! There was nothing bad about this hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Fantastic property, great location and good facilities. Clean rooms with a lovely bathroom and excellent room service. Breathtaking view from the top and great breakfast."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,Nice and clean rooms. Enough space. Excellent buffet for lunch. Nice pool. Very friendly staff. Construction site right next to the hotel and they also worked during the night. Quite cold ambiance.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,"Nice and clean room , beautiful shopping mall  All were good "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I like the room, staff, breakfast & infinity pool Shower force was low as I was staying in the 8th floor"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Structure of Hotel Clean and cooperative environment
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Top management, helpful friendly staff, spacious rooms with terraces - even though we hate that gimmick ""bathroom with glass window towards bedroom and not properly closing glass door"". The pool area on the 10th floor was designed according to the pool area of the Marina Sands in Singapore, but is a lot nicer. It might not have spectacular views, but it is more intimate, less crowded, has a lovely little garden and - apart from the big swimming pool - a wonderful little hot pool with view of the city and drink service. There is a restaurant and a bar at the same level, and you can enter the adjacent shopping center from there. A gym exists as well, of course.The kitchen tries to keep all nations happy and provides a tremendous choice, both at breakfast as well as at the dinner buffet. This, however, has an effect on the quality of the individual dishes - a little less a bit more authentically prepared would be better. The shopping center offers entertainment for the kids and the young at heart.The beach is across the road but nothing special - like a lot of beaches in Sri Lanka. The main road on the opposite side of the hotel, 10 minutes by foot or 3 by tuk tuk has a lot of shops and restaurants. We enjoyed the very elegant way the reception ladies wear their saris!Depending on the current rate the hotel charges, a very good option for a stay in Colombo. We hate bathrooms with glass windows and glass doors!"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,i thought the location is good and overall customer service was quite good in all areas.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,pool and mall attached were the best things about the hotel.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Clean and fresh room. Nice rooftop pool with a beautiful view over the ocean where you can watch the sunset. Perfect breakfast with a big variety. I can really recommend this hotel!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Swimming Pool is one of Best I have ever seen great 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We had one night here after arriving in Colombo mid afternoon. Great hotel overlooking the sea. A lovely rooftop pool and gymnasium, the gym was very well equipped. All the staff were very friendly. Breakfast had a good selection and we sat outside with the views which was great. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel.
 Breakfast was not the best standard buffet I’ve had, but something for everyone."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff are so much friendly and always willing to help even the security guards. Cleanliness, food and facilities available, are marvelous. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Pool. Cleanliness and bathrooms are amazing. Comfy bed. No pool side food. Not many seats next to pool.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"- great amenities
- good food
- central location
- fabulous pool
- excellent room
- mini bar drinks and snacks included in rate - room service forgot an item off order and then brought it 45 mins after which meant we were already done eating the rest of meal and half asleep so it was a waste of food we paid for"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I stayed at Marino for nearly two weeks. very well maintained property, good security at entrance. Good service. Room is beautiful and clean with ocean view and everything else needed. The staff are very kind, welcoming and helpful. Good menu for room service. The buffet is very reach good value for money. The Gym has everything including a rowing machine, a trainer if needed, good view, air conditioning, and very clean. The swimming pool is one of the best rooftop infinity pools in Colombo. The bar by the pool has a good menu and food as well. Highly recommended, will come back. It is not property specific, but needs to be as instructions in all hotels in the area, some guests from some areas have a tendency to stare and harass women by the pool who are single/not escorted by a man. That is the one thing that can make the experience very unpleasant. It should be explained at entrance or even added as part of hotels’ policy instructions to all male guests at the hotels, that it is unacceptable to approach, stare or take photos of women by the pool and in general. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The incredible view from the pool, the gym was really good for a hotel gym and the bed spacious and comfy.  Nothing it was perfect "

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great infinity pool, rooftop garden, breakfast, very friendly staff  With the room temp set at 22 degrees, I felt the need for a light duvet. The sheet alone was coool. Above 23 and it was a little warmish. A light duvet would have made an excellent stay close to perfect. Thank you
"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"everything was superb bar the below; , however I was on the 3rd floor and it was very noisy all night - I think because the restaurant was below."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The breakfast was the best that we have in Sri Lanka, so many options. The hotel is located in a shopping mall so all the shops and restaurants are close. There is also many entertainment options like cinema, VR, bilard. We loved jacuzzi and the infinity pool. It was a little bit noisy because of the construction close by.We paid for superior room and we received it bit on the lowest floor and our view from the balcony was on ugly and poor buildings."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"- It was an average hotel. Although brand new (a year old) it felt dated in its finishing. 
- We enjoyed the breakfast.
- The food in the bar was nice 
- The price was good 
- The rooms were big 
- good for a night or stopover  - We paid for the room when we checked in which is fine but then they wouldn’t let us put anything on the room when we visited the restaurant etc. This was quite annoying.
- the finishing of the hotel did not live up to the images of the hotel. 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The breakfast has a wide selection. We arrived late in the night, so we arranged for a car form the hotel to pick us up from the airport. It was clean, affordable, and nice. The rooms were clean and spacious, with modern furniture. The shower was very nice and the water was hot. Check in and check out was easy and they even had a desk to help book us a car for our next destination. Nothing to note."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The infinity pool and the stunning view of the sea with modern and sophisticated amenities, Inhouse mall and eateries and pubs Marino is a one stop shop. An experience to stay here for sure :) Checkin process was so slow that we had to wait for 45 mins.. This was the case with most of the guests that day. If this issue is fixed this is an epic place to stat "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Very tidy place. Excellent customer service. Nice sea views.  Broken wardrobe handle and bathroom door lock didn't work.  I assume maintenance work not done properly. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,I fell in love with my room! The view I had of the beach and the contrast with the city was incredible! I loved waking up every morning to the view the sunlight and sound of the crashing waves and city sounds.  The pool area is great but not totally my style.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Location. Clean n comfortable rooms. Good view rooms. Bed was very comfortable. TV options rather poor and the quality can be better. Amenities in room are good and adequate. Specially the front door staff are very kind and extremely helpful.  Some of the drinks displayed in menu was not available continuously.  Often other favourites they say sorry. Room service menu was poor and food quality when ordered late in the night was very poor. Checkin was not very professional and you will have more training staff then qualified staff. Be sure to get the name of the staff if you ask for special help or arrangements. Otherwise you will have to start over again. The rose lounge staff appears to be unconcerned and unhelpful. Theirs is take it or leave its attitude. Very poor service there. The Tide restaurant serves a good buffet with a wide variety of local and international food. Bfast lay out was superb with a good sea view.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Location and nice property
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"5 star comfort for 4 star price! Very friendly and helpful staff. Free minibar ( non alcoholic). Amazing roof top infinity pool and roof top garden ( Real trees and real grass)! Amazing view of city of Colombo and the Indian ocean from the roof top viewing platform. Excellent beach front location and walking distance to the CBD. Buffet dinner was value for money.Deputy Front office Manager Mr. Julian Cabraal and Guest relation officer Ms. Nishani were very friendly and helpful.Will definitely stay here again. Nothing! Everything was so good!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,We loved everything at this city hotel. From the food options to the amazing pool; I think the pictures in the web site do not make justice of it. It is much nicer in the reality. And the roof garden. A slice of heaven in the busy town of Colombo.  We enjoyed the delicious and large selection at breakfast. A place to keep in mind for our future visit to this town. Just a bit annoying the construction going on at the opposite building.  But not that much 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It has 5 start quality at its best Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Hotel is everything you would expect from a 5* although unfortunately we didn’t get chance to use the pool as weather was bad. Room was clean and staff were great. Lovely place to stay after a long flight!

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,I was nervous booking this hotel as I know that in Sri Lanka they post photos that are not real. This was even better than the photos! I stayed with my cousin who is pregnant and they were so wonderful to her and we had the most relaxing time. The pool is out of this world and the facilities are amazing. We had such a relaxing 3 days and would definitely stay here again.

Great selection of food, excellent quality! The rooms were immaculate and the view breathtaking(I was on the 8th floor) Service at Tides restaurant was amazing. Great staff. Service at the Ocean grill was the only negative. we went for dinner at 9:30 pm. no waiter came by to ask us what wanted, had to go find someone and ask to take our order. There were only 1 other table inside and maybe 3 outside, so was not busy, and then food took 40 min to be delivered. Once food was delivered, no one came by to ask how it was or if we needed anything else. I would not go back to the Ocean bar and grill for food as I was extremely disappointed by lack of service. Food was good but took too long to come considering restaurant was nearly empty. The service at Tides was the exact opposite, excellent waitstaff, excellent food."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Great 4-star hotel, right in the center of the city. The staff were friendly, and rooms were nice, comfortable and clean. We only stayed for 1 night so didn't use any of the facilities but from whatever little we saw of the hotel, it seemed good value for money. The food in the hotel lobby was the same as the night before. Also the lighting in the lobby (where the guest rooms were located) wasn't the best. But no major issues with the hotel"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The property are maintained excellently. The wonderful things is the bottle drinking water are free as much as i needed. I never find it in any other hotels. The pool attendants are not friendly in day 1 buy from next day we make him suit to us with our experience

Breakfast was delicious, as was the room service. As a tea lover, it was great to get a nice big mug in the room for our tea in the morning. It is called Marino Beach but there is no actual beach. The view is still good but there are quite a few noisy trains that run along the front of the hotel. As a tea lover, the big mugs were good but it would have been nice to have more then 2 tea bags in the room."

Hotel is next to the railway (unfortunately, all the hotels around beach promenade are) and also in between of construction site, so gets very noisy. That is due to the fact that Colombo is developing so quickly around sea."

Great breakfast. I didn’t like that smoking was allowed in the bar. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"The Roof Top Infinity Pool was amazing and the staff were lovely The food was ok however, need to improve on.. all Sri Lankan food was lovely though"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,There service was fantastic and the rooms very clean. The shower was next level! 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Room size, furniture and commodities were very good. Room service always on time and the rooftop was just amazing  A staff member from the restaurant was very kind and helpful. However all he wanted was getting too personal to reach our Facebook profile to be added as friend. Very unprofessional from him. Complaint was made at reception with manager. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The room and the bathroom were very nice and clean. The pool are is very nice, there are many restaurants in the building. The breakfast buffet is extraordinary. The walls are VERY thin, you can practically hear what people are talking about in the next room. There are not enough sunbeds by the pool.I think we got a superior room, although we booked deluxe (we payed as for a superior room and the room corresponded to the description of a superior room), so that was not really fair. In the restaurants be careful what you pay for - they write on the bill other prices than menu. The internet was not always stable."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Rooftop pool and friendly staff.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,This is one of the best hotels i ever stayed. Shall be my hotel whenever i visit Colombo 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I had high expectations of this place and was in no means disappointed. Happy from the start. Reasonably priced transfer available at the airport. Check-in was fast and efficient. Room very clean and large. Lovely balcony with sea view. Big bath. Water pressure and temperature generally very good. Facilities in room very good. Slippers and bath gown provided as well as drinks and snacks. But the best part was the complementary excellent selection of teas. Tried the room service food on a couple of occasions. Very good price, good quality and far too generous portions. But the absolute best part was the breakfast. Although many international options are available the best part was all the local foods, huge range of fresh and tasty curries and accompaniments. Swimming pool very impressive. Gymnasium well equipped and provides fresh towels and water. Hotel location is good as there are many shops and restaurants in the area. To get into more central parts of Colombo it is very easy to step out of the hotel or walk through the shopping centre attached and catch a cheap tuk tuk. Room was cleaned once and sometimes even twice each day, very impressed with the attentive but not overbearing service in all parts of the hotel. Before checking out one of the managers personally delivered a small gift to our room, very nice touch. Could not have enjoyed our stay more and would very much like to return. I am sure some people would find things to complain about, but I could not have been happier with our stay."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We love everything! From their friendly staff, the beautiful room as well as the rooftop garden and their amazing infinity pool, we felt like not wanting to leave. I regret I only booked for 1 night and there’s no available room the next day. They have wide selections of food as well. Plus the hotel looks very festive.  Excellent stay! None."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Nice pool on the rooftop, great breakfast  Large hotel, a bit impersonal"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Hotel Ambience, cleanliness and most importantly LOCATION There's Nothing I didn't like....I just loved almost everything."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The staff that were at Marino Beach were very helpful and made the stay even more enjoyable. The food emporium covered lots of people’s tastes and the Marino Mall was easy to get to and there were lots of shops to buy from. My room was big, comfortable and was cleaned regularly. We love everything."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Has everything! Loved the property and it’s location.  Food! It’s a great spread but taste needs to be improved. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The view is amazing, like in the photos, room was very clean, a good diversity of food and everyone was very nice.
 The construction that was nearby and the train was a bit noisy also in the night, but was not so disturbing we could sleep. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,It was an amazing experience staying with Marino beach! The hot tub and pool made an amazing end to our tiresome backpacking trip through srilanka! We stayed there our last day and we are so glad we decided to go with Marino beach! Loved everything 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Excellent facilities. Strong wifi.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything about the property is great.
Location - right at Main Street, we took AC bus from Hikkaduwa & it dropped us at its gate. Adjacent Marino mall, McDonald’s, Casinos ( complimentary pick and drop was a delight). Then at the front you have this indescribable ocean view.
Room- Great room with everything you need, in room dine was a delight 
Facilities- Great infinity swimming pool at 10th floor. Nice bar and garden on 10th floor. Pub is also there to enjoy ur night.
 Us being from India, No Hindi/ Punjabi music in Pub was the only let down during our stay "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything besides the food was exceptional. The food was abysmal.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,Great location and rooms along with friendly staff! We checked in at 10 PM that night but couldn't get a later check out than 1 30 PM due to rooms being fully booked which we understand. But we also couldn't use the hotel facilities post that (like the pool) as our cards would be disabled.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,Construction work in the building next to the hotel was loud 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly, rooms were clean and spacious and the pool was lovely. We had breakfast and headed straight to the rooftop and it was quite, making it feel even more lux.  No negatives."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"We had a flight that landed very early and although we had asked for an advance early check in and were denied on email, when we go to the hotel at about 9am they found a room for us with no extra charge. This is the first time any hotel has done that and it really made such a difference to our trip to be able to have the luxury of somewhere to leave our bags, and relax after a long flight.
Don’t be fooled by the underwhelming lobby.
The swimming pool is unreal, simply stunning and the owner has done well to make the rest of the hotel basic but modern and make the pool the highlight and focal point.
There really isn’t much to do in Colombo (whatever you read online is clearly misguided) so to be able to hang out in a paradisal oasis is just heavenly.
The rooms were clean with nice amount of space- it’s not the 4 seasons but to recharge yourself for a night or 2 is perfect.
The breakfast buffet is very international, serving all types of food from all over the world.
So there is also a shopping mall connected, which usually would frighten any type of traveller including us. Our first day we went in search of markets and “local” shopping areas and honestly didn’t find anything that we thought we would. We found an amazing shop inside this mall called Shreedevi Batik with local designs and fabrics for men and woman. It was exactly what we were looking for, with nice shirts with patterns on and shirt dresses etc. Well worth checking out.
We were travelling to trincomalee as our next destination which is really really really far away and we were struggling to find a taxi, the hotel organised one for us for a pretty reasonable price too. Shanka drove us for our 6 hour journey and was absolutely lovely, pointing out all the elephants along the side of the road and poor guy drove back again in the middle of the night.
Basically they are more than happy to assist to your needs, which these days you don’t really get anymore at hotels. That the balconies weren’t very private- you walk out and there is someone sitting next to your balcony looking at you. Maybe a higher divider that isn’t glass would be better. Besides that everything else was great. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very white and nice hotel, good location, a lot of restaurants and mall around. Cosy swimming pool with the garden at the top.  Nothing "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Everything was super nice especially the top floor with the bars and infinity pool.  One issue was that the room service was super busy to clean the room. We had left the room and put on the room service sign and we got back in the afternoon and it wasn’t cleaned. Then we went for dinner and asked for the room to be cleaned but again, it wasn’t cleaned. However everything else about this hotel was really great honestly "

The staff needs work. A lot of delay in bringing stuff to the room and checking in."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool is amazing, and the staff were super helpful. The rooms are beautiful and the TV actually worked! There is no footpath outside the hotel, so you have to catch a cab or tuktuk. This is not the hotel's fault, just a feature of Colombo"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Food & service Can't walk to the beach 
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,Brilliant breakfast. Marvellous staff. The pool is heavenly. It really would be nice to have umbrellas by the pool. Direct sunlight is really very unpleasant.

Definitely worth spending a little more to arrive in luxury! We couldn’t fault it! 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"We stayed for 3 days, beautiful hotel clean and very friendly staffs. The best facilities like the roof top swimming pool and gym  Should have given more emphasis on Sri Lanka deserts "

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything. As soon as we touched down, we met a rep from the hotel who treated us like royalty and ensured that Transportation to the hotel was arranged as quickly as possible. When we got to the hotel everyone went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and valued. I was a great start to our honeymoon and we really want to come back! Nothing. It was perfect!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"They were very kind to let me check in early. I found all food, drinks and service was really good. The room was excellent, shower was great. Rooftop pool was lovely! The little step into the lobby ladies room...please put a sign. I stubbed my toe every time!"

marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Rooms are beautiful; very modern, stylish and spacious. Rooms have a partial sea view. Rooftop infinity pool is fabulous. Breakfast buffet is exceptional. Marino Beach has everything you would expect of a 5* hotel anywhere in the world. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Nice hotel, with good pool at the top, very comfortable and clean rooms.  I have stayed two times, first time I was living in the room for disabled person, frankly it was not comfortable. I think staff should ask in advance, if is ok."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Clean, basic hotel. Perfect for a stop over in Colombo. Prices reasonable compared to other 5 star hotels The room we got overlooked a roof and a construction site. Noise travels easily within rooms and from corridor so a bit noisy."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Food was tasty and presented well N/a
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"AMAZING infinite pool at the roof. The rooms are very modern and clean. The hotel is in a good neighborhood of Colombo. The breakfast is really good except the coffee which is a complete joke. As is very common in Sri Lanka (and India): the staff is polite but very inefficient. Takes a forever to get your drink, food, check-in etc. The coffee at the breakfast is absolutely disgusting (although they have a small café down in the lobby that serve good coffee)."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,The Pool
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Swimming pool on the rooftop
Kindly and polite stuff 
my friend left his things in the locker; his airplane pillow for sleeping was accidentally ruined.  and bought him a new pillow"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Great facilities in a hotel that is only about 18 months old. The staff is very keen to help you.  The best tea selection and quality in any hotel I have stayed at, in over 30 years of frequent travel. Not surprising as the owner of the hotel also owns a tea plantation in Sri Lanka.  Also a very large comprehensive buffet b'fast of cold and hot food. Good value for money with great service, from excellent friendly staff. The concierge service will arrange just about anything for you. The hotel taxi service to the airport was prompt and excellent, in a clean lovely BMW sedan! A little too much bowing and scraping from extremely enthusiastic staff.  Their willingness to help is great, but sometimes it was over the top and it just made feel a bit uncomfortable. Maybe a bit of a culture clash?"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,We stayed in the hotel on our first night in Srilanka. It was a great hotel with a beautiful 10th floor infinity pool with a view over the ocean. This was a great place to start our journey. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was out of the way so no city noise at night.  The hotel served a great breakfast in the morning When we went to organize the transportation back to the airport for a early morning check-in .The staff at the transportation desk were not helpful. They said they could not accommodate us and did not have any idea how we would get to the airport . I had to ask to speak to the general manager who eventually arranged for two taxi's to pick us up. it was a very strange reaction to a simple request . Make sure you ask early if you need transportation
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,wonderful hotel and wonderful staff.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"There was so much to do onsite, from restaurants, gym, swimming pool (with amazing views) and a nightclub which was a perfect place to ring in the new year (the nightclub is open to guests and the public so it was great to party with the locals) 
All the staff we’re lovely and attentive and the We ordered room service for our breakfast and after being told it would take 20-30 mins, it took more like an hour+ 
Secondly there was a lot of things faulty/ falling apart I.e the sofa with all the pen scribbles in our room, the flush panel falling off, the plug hole handle coming out and the weighing scales not working
Lastly - we had a terrible experience when checking out. The gentleman at the desk was terribly patronising after my card had issues with payment. I knew very well that I had sufficient funds HOWEVER he implied we couldn’t afford it which I felt was very unacceptable and unprofessional. Turned out (after having to call my bank) the issue was with the hotels card machine.
I didn’t even get an apology "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"All great, but the endless rooftop pool was the best! :) Would be nice to have an option not to have our towels changed every day or to be able to refill our own bottle with drinking water...but otherwise awesome, will gladly come back! :)"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,The ocean  Balcony glass was stained and after complaining three times all I got was sorry its from the sea. No other ways to keep me somewhat happy 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,There is lots of building work going on next to the property but easy to block out :) 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This hotel is really good! Worth price! When we checkin they offer us a ice juice, so so so sweet, pink color I think it’s guava juice, really like it. We like this hotel especially the top swimming pool, and gym. Everything is very well!The best hotel we been stay at Srilank! Also the breakfast buffet very good! Highly recommended. I booked 3 ppl so they should’ve 3 beds, after we ask they send the 3rd bed at very late night. "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,The swimmingpool on the rooftop is amazing and so is the jacuzzi😊 the beds were comfortable😊
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The food was amazing. 
The pool was lovely and they had a good gym and a garden that I could do my yoga practice in. The staff were very attentive ,warm and very friendly "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,"Hotel is suoer nice, clean and pool area is super nice. There are many restaurants and the food is ok so if you dont want to leave the hotel at all during your stay in Colombo, that is possible over there. So very good facilities. Prices for food and drinks were in reasonable level, not too expesive. The biggest negative surprise in hotel were the level of service, it wasnt in a proper level for 5 star hotel. I talked couple times with same man in reseption and he was unpolite to me, almost rude. I dont know was the problem that I’m western woman because there were also some other situations where the staff mostly just serve men in our group, not women. I understand culture differences, but this is only place where I have faced this in Sri Lanka and 5 star hotel is last place where I expect to faced this kind of behaviour towards customer. Also staff werent so pro active for example in pool area so you need to go and find them if you wanted some drinks. 
Free minibar was a bit dissapointment, there where only couple limonades and one small juice. Spa prices were super expensive."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything  Nothing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,All the facilities you need. Beautiful rooms.  The infinity pool should remain open till at least midnight. Deposit system to pay for facilities at check in is always a bad idea because it makes guests feel they are being sold things they don’t need. Scrap it. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel had kindly upgraded our room and it was delightful surprise after a long day of travelling from the UK. We relaxed by the amazing infinity pool, watching our first ever Sri Lankan sunset! The gym was great and the staff throughout the hotel were lovely!"

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"All staffs are polite and kind with smile. The room is spacious and super clean, which made me feel so relaxed and secured after long flight. The bathroom is superb and functional. I was so impressed with the quality of amenities ( especially tea selection). The breakfast is really yummy. I will definitely be back. Highly recommended. None (the breakfast room is little bit noisy with children, but this is not hotel's fault.)"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The lavish breakfast and dinner buffets. The large room with luxurious bathroom. The sample tea options. The free mini bar. The thoughtful parting gift and endearing note on the eve of our departure.  Unfortunately, there is a huge building going up in front of the infinity pool.. No fault of the hotel though.. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Breakfast was excellent. Staff is very very kindly as well as service.  I was trying to pay for breakfast online , but it was impossible. Maybe something is wrong with your  software or with Internet."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Excellent choice of restaurants. Pool area also really good
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The rooms are great! Location is brilliant! Courteous staff! The waiting time for the lifts. Either they need to have more lifts or a lot bigger ones for the size of the hotel.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Excellent
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The size of the room and bathroom very big and comfortable. Although the name say Marino beach there is really no. Beach although it is located just less than 100 meters from the ocean with only a busy road and railway tracks in between. Nevertheless if you get an Ocean View room facing the road you get an infinite uninterrupted view of the ocean."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The location of the hotel is amazing, you can reach all of the important things in Colombo quickly. The staff are helpful and the chef Mr. Irosh Perera and his team are producing fantastic dishes in the Tide Restaurant. The standard 50m swimming pool on the 10th floor is fantastic and the gym is also well-equipped."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,everything!
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The rooms and facilities are absolutely amazing. They have one of the best pools I've had the pleasure of using. Great bars and restaurants in the hotel and the location is amazing.  The check-in staff was one of the worst I've ever seen, while checking us in she was muttering to herself and it was really difficult to understand her. She didn't greet us, didn't offer us a welcome drink. She didn't have a clue about good customer service and providing a customer experience. As the face of the hotel I expected better. "

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Staff were amazing, attentive without being intrusive,  helpful and always smiling. Particularly our room attendant Sampath Fernando who attended to all our requirements and when asked a question he always answered politely and if he couldn't answer he would follow up and find out and let us know. Will be staying again in 3 weeks time during our return to Colombo before flying home. Would recommend to everyone
 Nothing "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The rooms were very comfortable and the cleaning staff worked very hard at keeping the rooms clean.  The location was great and transportation was very accessible from the hotel.  The infinity pool was to die for - such gorgeous sunsets.  The facilities was great - just a very very comfortable stay - great way to end off our journey in Sri Lanka. No complaints.  The breakfast was additional cost - so we opted not to have breakfast at the hotel.
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Beautiful pool area. Good breakfast. Lovely staff  Building work spoiled the ambiance at the pool. Hotel was a little tired in places.

marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Impeccable staff, quick room service, great pool, food is amazing! Clean lobby with great security. The view is amazing! You could see where they cut corners to have the room cleaned quickly. Also when you get off the elevator to go to your room, there is an odd smell which isnt very inviting."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing staff and facilities. The food was delicious.  We had a late flight the evening of our check out. There’s wasn’t anywhere for guests to freshen up/shower before heading to the airport. The showers at poolside were ok, however didn’t provide any hair dryers etc. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"The Rooftop pool is really nice especially at sunset, the room was big and comfy with a nice view "

marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The staff, the facilities and the cleanliness were brilliant. Too much butter on the vegetables during the buffet"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"So nice service, excellent conditions and location. Besides the ocean and so beautiful canteen. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The Infinity pool is defenitley the highlight of this property. Can spend hours here. The break fast spread is actually a feast and you can easily add calories unless u are careful ! For a Hotel as this the in house WiFi must be easy to configure and a breeze to work. I am a geek myself and gave up after some wasted minutes trying to connect.  This for sure is a big minus. And the low rating for Facilities is due to this"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"The rooms are spacious, pool and garden, the food and buffet selection were great (I was only missing a fish option). Very new, clean and well equipped gym.
And an AC which is not annoying at all 👍 
For me the perfect way to say good bye after 3 weeks of travel. The construction next to the hotel. Is obviously not the fault of the hotel, but if you wanna spend some hours of your day at the pool and want to relax you should know. 
Some more smaller dumb bells would be nice, only one pair of 2kg and than a jump to 5kg and 7,5kg 
"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Infinite pool was a must have experience. Room was a newly built rom with beautiful interior as well as top of the class amenities. Breakfast was good. Had a wide range of selection and was worth the money. Staff was friendly, warm and welcoming. The upper deck is a must visit."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"the location was good. the breakfast was excellent, lots of variety and was so satisfying even for a vegetarian. the room was also well maintained. the housekeeping was also good. the infinity pool was the icing on the cake. i and my daughter enjoyed the most. overall great place and gud hotel. the hotel was beautifully decorated. Our check in took one hour. we had travelled from Kandy to colombo nearly 6 hours of journey and coz of poor staff at reception our check in was delayed. they also made us wait to give us our room as they said the rooms were not clean. we had two rooms but they provided only one room and the next room was given to us after an hour, which was also done after reminding them. The services were very poor at the reception. there is also one more problem - there is some construction work going on in the neighbouring plot which was very noisy. the work was going on even late in the evening. we could not fully enjoy the infinity pool which is on the top floor in view of the constant noise"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Swimming pole, garden bar and reception area Near by new building construction noise "
marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,Rooftop swimming pool and the garden!
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The facilities were fantastic. Our room had an excellent view and the infinity pool was outright amazing. The hotel also offers a great rate for currency exchange. Prices were slightly higher than other parts but that is understandable as this is the capital.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,The breakfast and the pool  are amazing 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,I really like with the the service they have provided me. best place in the town

I want to say thank u to reservations ( were very patient to my requests and implemented it in a perfect way! Without any delay bringing outstanding service especially room attender ( I don’t remember his name ) & many thx front office lady Janen she is new but I can feel enthusiasm at her work - very lovely lady. I wish her good luck in her career. Many thx to taxi driver ( pick up at the airport & drop off- well done guys! Wht can I say - resort is marvelous full of positive and professional people! Applause to Resort Manager - taking good care about his employees! I’ll be definitely back!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The pool and surprise jacuzzi and hot tub were a real treat as well as the shower facilities by the pool including washing materials and lockers!The lunch buffet was the best I’ve tasted having travelled to many counties. Exceptional value for money! The view from the left wing is a construction site of a nearby office block/hotel which means you can’t keep curtains open for the partial sea view (although can use the privacy curtain) also unfortunately makes the rooftop fairly noisy, but the hotel plays nice music upstairs which almost drowns it out. It’s not a fault of the hotel but something to bare in mind."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Sparkling clean and rooms were in excellent conditions , Very friendly ,genuine & young ,Matured staff .The food quality & taste of the buffets were excellent, Very creative presentation all over . The Chinese restaurant  served good authentic Chinese food and good ambience at the restaurant. Quality Gym for the work out !

Will definitely visit agin . Nothing to find .."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,"Good restaurants, great gym, great pool, good security the staff was amazing. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Plush facilities, friendly staff.  There is a high-rise building site directly next to the hotel, work being undertaken 24 hours a day, so, although the view from the infinity pool is amazing when you look one way, out to sea, directly opposite is a towering building site, with cranes, banging and drilling - by the looks of it this will continue for a long while yet.

The rooftop pool ... wow!"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"The room was nice and spacious, but the best part was the infinity pool. It's a pity the staff didn't keep the kids to the kids section with them throwing balls etc. Probably also a safety hazard.  Everything was great except the breakfast. Although there was alot to choose from - egg station, bacon, sausages (port, beef and chicken) basically a full hot breakfast, American style breakfast - donuts, waffles, pancakes, Japanese sushi and Chinese breakfast... All fantastic except two things - the hot  food (British hot food) was cold (I typically arrive at breakfast at 9am as they close at 10am - I'm a late starter) and the donuts and muffins didn't seem fresh."

From the lobby we met the GRO and she was v helpful and passed us to her superior. But that gentlemen instantly said NO to us.  Not its not possible or unfortunately it is not allowed but simply NO. That seemed very rude for us. Other then that incident we had the best stay. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Awesome breakfast made my morning healthy. Property is located just on the sea. What a beautiful scene from hotel terrace. Rooftop garden & swimming pool is excellent. Room, lobby & every place were neat & cleaned. Staff is very courteous & ready to help with beautiful smile. House keeping staff is also very courteous. Being 5 star facility & guests are coming from various cities of the world, hotel must provide pick up & drop off facility. Hotel should add more items in Pure vegetarian menu."

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"great food, friendly staff, loved the infinity pool and bar, the room and view was fabulous the security on the balcony, as the partition between rooms was only a short glass partition and easily accessible for one to jump over to the other room.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The Hotel has it all. The room was very nice with all things which you need from this class of the hotel. As for food options you can chose from different restaurants. Near Mall is additional asset. In the evening you can choose the disco or garden party. The pool on the roof is amazing! Our stay was perfect! Nothing which would be worth mentioning.

The food is also amazing and so much choice. The welcome drink on arrival was so badly needed and gorgeous. The staff also helped me with my lost luggage.  Everything was gorgeous and I’d definitely recommend a stay here for the pool alone. 
Only downside to the rooftop pool is a building in the process of being built next door is quite noisy and relentless but the hotel have no control over that. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Excellent stay over here clean & spacious Staff can be more professional 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Infinity pool and roof garden area  is amazing! Rooms are very nicely furnished and clean, staff very helpful. Checkout took maybe 15 seconds. Need to preauthorise card to use hotel restaurants / services is a minor annoyance."

A roof top garden on the 10th floor with pool and an unbelievable garden. None"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.3 ,Property is new and very well maintained
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The pool and rooftop were amazing and never too busy.  The buffet breakfast was delicious and the rooms comfortable and spotless. The service was excellent. This was a fantastic way to spend our last night in Sri Lanka The building works across from the pool (a different site) but this is not in the control of the hotel and i was able to block it out whilst relaxing on the rooftop. 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Excellent hotel with great views of the sea, especially from the swimming pool. Construction next to the hotel building another hotel. Very loud."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Nice hotel and a lovely roof terrace with a cool infinity pool. Very good breakfast. The hotel is located very close to the sea, but there is a big road and a railway between the hotel and the sea, and there is no beach nearby, so swimming has to be in the infinity rooftop pool, which isn't bad. The sunset over the sea is beautiful from the rooftop/pool."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"The breakfast was pretty good I'd give it a 8 out of 10. The room was clean and had ample space. The washroom was also very clean and was well designed and equipped. Small balcony but given my fear of heights I didn't step out, but the view was amazing even though it was a partial ocean view room. The restaurant takes time to serve you, so if you are hungry... pre plan your hunger. I feel there should be a lot more veg friendly options."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Property was clean with lots to see/do and places to eat. Staff were extremely helpful and after travelling for such a long time to a country me and my partner had never before it was nice to be heard and treated so kindly. Definitely recommend.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Helpful, professional and kind staff. Clean and modern facilities  They made no mention of our honeymoon even though they were aware of it. Its definitely not something that's necessary but would have been a nice personal touch. Location is a bit further out from the sights and the room service food was not good. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything is perfect here! New hotel, modern, clean, friendly staff,with amazing swimming pool. Great deal! You have to pay at the begining the booking and even if you gave them your credit card, if you didnt open a bill you have to pay roomservice, restaurant, every smoothie at the pool everytime you order it, right away. Very inconvinient, as you have to carry money or your credit card everywhere in the hotel."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,The infinite pool/ jacuzzis at the top are amazing. The room was great.  We only stayed for one night before flying home but wished we had stayed longer. This hotel felt like a calm place in the middle of the very busy noisy city of Colombo. 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"friendly helpful staff, very informative. extensive choice off food in the restaurant. wonderful roof top swimming pool to watch the sun sets from.even on checkout we were given a packed lunch to take with  the airport, even though it was not mentioned when we booked.  our driver Ashley was wonderful and made our trip to the airport great with all the infomation he gave us about his country. NOTHING"
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Rooms are spacious with a comfortable bath attached. Buffet breakfast/lunch/dinner had lot of choices. The hosts in the restaurant were all very young, energetic and always available to help if anything was needed. Nothing serious to dislike. However there was an incident which I wanted to point out here and is not important or affecting the rating of this property. I had a pedestal lamp near the writing desk which was not working and I had complained on the first day of arrival. The same was not taken care of till I left. This may not be a problem when the room had enough lighting from other lamps. But that sticks as a sore thumb in the whole experience."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Massage / service by pool side was great. Breakfast buffet one of the best ever. Highly recommend.

The staff were also kind enough to allow late check out.
The infinity pool looked amazing, but we did not get to try it out this time... I suppose its something to do when we visit the next time.  The lock in the room was not working properly, however the staff attended to it and got it fixed. The toilet part of the bathroom also had a slight smell, but apart from that the rest of the room was very clean. "

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Without doubt one of the favorite hotel We stayed in Sri Lanka! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staf. They were extremely friendly. Room was clean and relatively new too.The food was amazing.It was affordable but also luxurious. We had two great evenings here, which obviously also added up to the experience. Nothing special, Everything was perfect. Need to add some sign board to locate car park, shopping mall etc. Keep some books about Sri Lankan attractions in the room. Need to clean balcony chairs regularly since it located the heart of the town."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The staff were all very friendly and security was very good on the front door.

The sun beds were not particularly comfortable, they could do with a thin mattress on them"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Breakfast was excellent! Restaurant 10th floor
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,Large room and beautiful bathroom. Greeted with a tasty juice. The rooftop pool was gorgeous at sunset. We were offered the use of the pool and change room as we had a later departure. The floor transition from the hall and bathroom had a lip which we constantly stubbed our toes on. The concierge staff seemed a bit rushed and some of their information about hours of some sites was inaccurate.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Roof top restaurant bar and Infinity pool 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent friendly staff throughout our stay. Property was clean and tidy as you'd expect from a 5 star property in Europe. I'd recommend this property if you're looking for a nice place to relax either as a couple or family. Look elsewhere if you're looking to see local Colombo life. Tour desk organised a great city tour and airport drop off for us for a great price. Ashley was our driver and he was fantastic.  Noise from the floor above us during the day, some construction noise from the property next door but only affected us whilst at the pool not in the room. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Nice spacious property and friendly staff  A little away from amnesties 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Could not ask for a better hotel. The rooms are big, clean and modern. The staff are friendly. There is a mall and bars/restaurant within the complex and breakfast at the hotel is amazing, large variety and tasty. Full view of the sea from the rooftop pool makes for a beautiful sunset viewpoint. 100% would recommend and would stay again during my next visit to Colombo."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"The pool area was superb with infinity pool, kids pool, jacuzzi and great ambience. The breakfast had a lot of variety, but they could work on the taste of the wontons. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff at the reception took a very long time for check-in. We were very tired and the check in took almost 45 minutes. The staff there were not very cordial and welcoming whenever approached."
marino-beach-colombo, 7.9 ,"New and good pool on roof. Gym is excellent. Breakfast had a very good spread. My checkout took 30 minutes and they rang up an extra zero on my card and had to cancel it then stuffed up again. Staff were nice but I had a driver waiting.
The alacarte food was average. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everyone was super helpful and friendly. Amazing views from our room. Rooftop pool and garden was stunning and great for watching the sunset. Very relaxing and luxurious. We will be returning soon!

marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Everything staff and the whole hotel Nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Absolutely everything. Felt like royalty with the treatment I received from every member of staff. The food and drink were excellent and there was an added bonus of a shopping mall in the hotel and not forgetting the amazing infinity pool on the 10th. Floor . Would definitely recommend it for anyone planning to stay in Colombo. There was nothing not to like.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Everything in this hotel is  perfect, staff is very helpfull and professional, breakfast is rich and fresh, rooftop swimming pool, rooms and bathrooms are luxury Hotel and service are  perfect"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This is a 5 star hotel at an affordable price.  EVERYTHING about this hotel is fantastic... the room, the glass bathroom, complimentary snacks & soft drinks, fabulous infinity pool overlooking the ocean, roof top garden with real grass & trees, a choice of restaurants, wonderful variety at the buffet breakfast (typically included) with so many choices. A high level of security is obvious and a small shopping mall is attached.  The taxi shuttle to the airport is $15 US and is just for you personally (not multiple people).  When we arrived, we stayed in Negombo as it was close to the airport, but were disappointed.  Next visit we will go directly to Marino Beach hotel.  They firmly state that they can get you to the airport in 1 1/2 hours max. and they know alternate routes should there be traffic problems.  The hotel is Sri Lankan owned and is only 1 1/2 years old. The hotel arranged a taxi to Kandy for us and our driver, Gayan was very considerate and spoke excellent English.  A very experienced, professional and careful driver! It was all good!"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This was our second stay, and it was perfect. The issue highlighted during our last stay the appeared to have been resolved (or maybe that was a one off) 
The room was really nice and spacious and very clean.. The staff were friendly, right from the check in to room service. They made our stay really pleasant :) the room was cleaned whenever we requested. We also got to try out the infinity pool and the Jacuzzis with the amazing view this time. Dinner at the Tides restaurant was also impressive and good value.. Didn't get to try the breakfast (maybe something for next time ;) will recommend to anyone, and I don't think this will be our last stay... 
 There was nothing, everything was perfect "

marino-beach-colombo, 8.8 ,This is a high category hotel with all best in class facilities to enjoy and relax.  The personal is doing everything possible for their customers.  I enjoyed the nice pool on rooftop with garden. There is no beach attended to the hotel and the construction work across the street is very noisy and annoying; they are working around the clock but I guess it’s for a limited amount of time.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Rooftop pool and reasonable priced food  It’s a new property and cleaning can be better than it is 
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The rooms were large and comfortable. Staff were well-trained and very polite and helpful. The hotel has an attractive pool area on the top of the building, which is great for relaxing. I would go so far as to say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at! Nothing major to note. However, on our last night we were kept awake by music from a function taking place in the hotel. Although the staff was helpful in handling this (offering a new room), the hotel should be more mindful of the noise level stemming from in-house events."

Highly recommend. Location not fabulous. Lots of noisy construction. Is beachfront but beach not really accessible as water to edge of wall. You would have to cross railway lines to access.  Best to go to Mount Levine 15 minute tuk tuk ride to get there. But a wonderful hotel and I would stay there again.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"There was nothing to dislike at Marino Colombo, the services, the staff, the facilities. You ask for anything and they have it. The staff would always go out of their way to satisfy a customer.The hotel is so accommodating, I didn't feel like leaving. I stayed 1 day in the hotel making use of the Spa, the roof top swimming pool which has a breath taking view and you could get some great shots there too for the Gram :POverall I had an amazing stay at Marino Colombo. would definitely recommend this hotel.

marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The location is the main feature. It's right on the road facing expanse of sea. It's a posh side of Colombo with mall within the building, pharmacy and other shops nearby. The best feature is the infinity pool. I paid just to be in that pool. Really good breakfast as well. The housekeeping is a bit slack. My dad asked for a service that never got done. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,Nice pool and good location 
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The infinity pool on the roof is incredible, and open early / until late which we found wasn't the case in most other hotels in Sri Lanka. The rooms were large and very clean, and the service was very good."

marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"Good location, balconies with a view, awesome rooftop area with big pools, whirlpools and good views.  Baggage security check was out of order when we arrived. We had to open our bags in public and the bags were checked too much in our opinion. Security: yes, embarrassing arriving guests: no...
Room was clean but would need some maintenance e.g. loose water faucets.
Food was ok but nothing special. The restaurant staff was friendly but quite slow."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The well organised rooms, swimming pool and breakfast spread.  It's a fantastic hotel with very neatly made rooms which are spacious, well organised and equipped with most essential and modern facilities. Rooms have balconies too to get fresh air. The highlight is the infinity pool on the top floor which extends the entire depth of the hotel and merges with the views of the ocean on one end. The breakfast was magnificent and elaborate. Staff was very Swift and polite. I would love to stay in the hotel next time I'm in Colombo. "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I like the room, very clean and comfy. With the luxury from the aminites and facilities to the breakfast buffet and dine in food..its superb and with reasonable price...they have a nice infinity pool at the top of the hotel with incridible Garden in the sky...they have Marino Mall also at the back of the hotel in Galle Road..The staff are very helpful and polite especially from the check in which is very fast and the bellboy is so polite in the name of Shihan.I would highly recommend this for comfort stay in Colombo...very reasonable price and the location is within the city in colombo 03 I just felt uncomfortable when a bartender in the pool area force me to go back in my room to get a payment of my drinks...he just saw me that i just arrived and started drink and swim...but eventually he apologised when i increased my voice since i felt uncomfortable already...but i went back to my room instead and they sent the bill.But everything is perfect in Marino Beach Hotel."

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"It was ver clean, the staff was extremely helpful. You can’t swim in the sea."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.2 ,The rooftop pool is great - both at night and during the day. Had a meal in the ocean bar and grill which was perfectly adequate (good chips). Rooms are large and well kept.  Worth considering that to get there from the airport seemed quite a treck just for one night (although it could just have been the route our driver chose to take).
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The swimming pool is amazing! We got to see the train passing by the ocean at sunset, which is spectacular! The amenities in the room are also as expected! Nope "

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"This was our second time at this hotel.  We stayed 3 nights at the start of our 21 day vacation and just had to stay 3 more nights at the end!  This is a fantastic city hotel.  1.5 years old and very well designed.  The rooms are light and airy with all the amenities - even some complimentary soft drinks and cookies/peanuts.  A class act.  The signature roof top infinity pool and the natural park-like garden are a must-experience.  Huge selection at the breakfast buffet. Airport taxi pickup/drop is $15 US each way - thanks again to Gayan, a great taxi driver.  1.5 hours from the airport. Stay here while in Columbo!!! Nothing - it is all good."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Everything the hotel has to offer Nothing was like that

I even got a free room upgrade.  Not too much around the hotel but you have everything you need there. "

- The room access door to the balcony cannot be locked and can be accessed from other room balcony- safety and security need to check. This was inform to  the reception.

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Infinity pool on the roof is lovely, and the eating/drinking establishments in the hotel are pretty good. I loved that there were a couple of billiard tables in the Floatz Pub area, but didn't like that the billiards room also doubled as the only smoking room in the place. Had to play pool while surrounded by cigarette smoke and full ashtrays."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,This place is so good. Loved the staff and the food and that pool is just stunning. Would happily come back again

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Amazing place, specially the infinity pool!! A large infinity pool at that level gives you a breathtaking view. Restaurant and open garden is lovely too. Service is good, took less time for most of their services. Sea view room was very good. Inside atmosphere is really lovely and hotel lobby is nicely built."
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Breakfast service was excellent 
Cleaning staff wonderful  Related visited to see us one of the staff bit rude to them "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"I loved the facilities, the staff was mind and always available. The rooms are even better than the pictures, so modern but comfortable, with all the luxury. Excellent value for price, will come back for sure. I also stayed in Galle Face Hotel which was more expensive and still Marino Hotel was much better.   N/A"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"We've arrived earlier than check-in time (~9-10am), though were welcomed to stay either at chill-zone or in the lobby and once the room was ready (we waited less than 30 min) we got a text message that can collect our keys.The room is just like on the pictures: spacious, cozy, clean, lovely bathtub, balcony with the ocean view, etc. Once you get there - you wouldn't want to go out :) We were leaving the room only for the pool, restaurant and only once left the Hotel to buy train tickets.Pool on the top floor (actually on the roof) is just one love! There are plenty of deck-chairs, amazing views and lots of trees. And it's as easy to get burned as on the real beach, so be clever and get your sun-sprays.Breakfast is great! Lots of options to choose from either European or local\Eastern. We went 2 times for Dinner buffet to this restaurant and it's absolutely worth its price.We had a quite early check-out time and were provided with the take-away breakfast which was easy to carry away and copious.One day the room was cleaned twice! :) I believe by mistake, though still nice.Wish we could've planned a bit longer stay there :) The only minuses could be a noise from the construction outside (though you don't hear it if close the windows and at the pool area you can get a pair of ear defenders) and the location of the Hotel - it's not that easy to get there if not by taxi :)"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,Clean and modern room. The rooftop pool was super nice with great view. Location is good and not far from famous restaurants and attractions. Variety of buffet dinner was good but the quality could have been better. Breakfast could be improved.
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"The staff were sweet to upgrade us & put roses on the bed for our belated honeymoon. The room was nice. The view! 😂 the very spicy Sri Lankan food"
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"its   amazing

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,roof pool. Buffet. nothing
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"The entire experience start to finish was amazing. Because we were first time guests we got a complimentary upgrade. The bedrooms are very clean and high end. The bathroom and shower are amazing! The infinity pool is heaven. You’ll never want to leave. Chanaka at the pool was a great server, always making sure we had what we needed. The area feels safe and is quieter than the busy downtown pettah area. Breakfast is also very good and worth the money. Nothing! 10/10 stay!"
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Cannot find any quality issues with this hotel, but I would like to see the management to stop using plastic dispensers for shower and hand wash soap. On average they will throw 200 plastic bottles a day. They should install soap dispensers which ca be topped up. 
They. Should, once a week clean the beach rocks of all plastic waste. It may not be their responsibility but the world is one. 
Excellent hotel to stay, wonderful pool. Food
Pool
Friendly staff "
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,Amidst the chaos and lockdown for the Coronavirus. The staff at Marino were nothing short of exceptional. The food was still amazing and the facilities were fabulous. Highly recommend anyone to stay!! Nothing

marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Benchmark for 5 star hotels set. Perfect from every angle. Pool, restaurants, food, breakfast and of course the room."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,One of my favorite hotels in Sri Lanka. It’s my second time spending my bday here and staying at Marino is the best gift! Nishani from Guest Relations was very caring and attentive. She surprised me with a beautiful cake in the room and was very helpful during departure. Unfortunately trainees in reception don’t have personal name tags. Considering low occupancy they could give a room with a better view. Wish blankets on the bed were more puffy. It took 42 mins to fill a bath with water. When I asked guest service center to give me late checkout he asked me to press 6 and cut the line...at least he could just transfer my call directly.
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Outstanding facility and staff.Room is exceedingly comfortable, sparkling clean. Staff very helpful and responsive.We request a late checkout and allowed to use the pool after checkout.Infinity pool is amazing, great for swimming.Breakfast is sumptuous, buffet dinner is good for price.Highly recommend for outstanding value."

Great leadership from the Manager - Julian. Food in Tides restaurant & Cocktails in Sunset bar.. - ... EXCELLENT !! No Complimentary foot massage..! Ha.. Ha.."
marino-beach-colombo, 8.0 ,"The welcome and daily staff greetings were second to none, nothing was too much trouble. Excellent choice of breakfast, the hotel is kept immaculately.  One night two members of staff came into our room whilst we were sleeping. We woke up and caught up with them outside and they were very shifty, it made us uncomfortable so we called the front desk but nothing was resolved. "
marino-beach-colombo, 9.0 ,"Excellent value for money for this luxury hotel. The room was lovely with all the facilities you would expect. The rooftop area was gorgeous, with a great view over the sea facing sunset, an infinity pool, bar, garden, and lots of space to sit/lie around. The buffets in the main restaurant were good, with lots of choice.  Staff were helpful. Some of the restaurants and the spa were closed during our stay, but that was due to the coronavirus pandemic so not the fault of the hotel! This meant the only lunch or dinner choices were the buffet, which was good but a little bit pricey."
marino-beach-colombo, 10 ,"Pool, pool, pool, pool!!!!Mall is OKJust go to the pool!!!"

marino-beach-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great new facilities! Awesome roof swimming pool and absolutely stellar breakfast buffet! The bed was large and comfy. Prices at the hotel restaurants were not too high (lower then we have expected -  a nice surprise), so we just had our dinners and lunches at one of the 3 available restaurants. Very good stay! Totally recommend! The place is situated in the very center of Colombo - so getting anywhere outside the hotel involved spending time in traffic - ugh. Lots of construction happening around the place - so it is rather noisy outside and it does spoil the view."
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,Hospitality and the customer care at its best
shangri-la-colombo, 9.0 ,Everything was great
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"Excellent hotel. Shangri-La is, of course, an international chain but we were impressed that the hotel still exudes a decidedly warm Sri Lankan ambiance and character. Staff were all excellent and restaurants had fantastic food across a good range of cuisines. Chris in Concierge was brilliant; managed to organise us to visit new Parliament House at very short notice (not an easy task). Very happy to recommend"
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,The views. Too many people loitering around the ground floor making it very uncomfortable. Ground floor is too busy for my liking.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"Service, food, cocktails, room, pool..everything was exceptional.  N/a"
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,Everything  Nothing 
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,"The sheer range of the breakfast buffet and quality of the food. Great local and international selection. The ocean view was pretty average, that is mostly due to the construction work happening in the area so not really a modifiable factor."
shangri-la-colombo, 9.6 ,The staff were so helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast was excellent value and the food delicious. The room was very well appointed and we had an excellent view.
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,We very much pay attention to detail and this was excellent quality Nothing
shangri-la-colombo, 10 ,"In general, everything met or exceeded expectations. Staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast buffet was superb.  Honestly, nothing. It was great. "
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,"Breakfast and the fish restaurant was great. Stop playing the same song on repeat in the lobby and at breakfast. Some staff were abrupt and stern, some were lovely particularly in the restaurant"
pegasus-reef, 8.0 ,we had stayed 1 night at this place. food was fantastic. and location was amazing too.
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,Best value for the price. Not too far from the airport. The staff was lovely. It was a good place to relax and end our vacation. Nothing much to do around the hotel (nothing walking distance)
pegasus-reef, 8.0 ,Actually there was a good service.Tasty food. Nothing
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,"Extremely clean rooms - daily cleaning service. Spacious rooms with great facilities Staff were really lovely and friendly. Surrounding grounds lovely - pool and beach front Distance from Colombo was quite far - felt like we had to eat in the hotel due to the distance to travel. The food in the hotel wasn’t the best - the buffet didn’t have huge amount of choice and wasn’t extremely hot due to it being a buffet. During our stay there was a wedding to which the music played until early hours- maybe unlucky but our room was right outside the garden."
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,Very Good nothing
pegasus-reef, 8.8 ,"Pool and it’s surroundings. Quality service in the evening restaurant.
"
pegasus-reef, 9.0 ,"Staff was very good and helpful especially Waki R&B Manager and chef Sujith.Overall amazing property and we enjoyed our stay .. Breakfast was same everyday which was a bit boring...."
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,"Big property, the breakfast was amazing and the chefs and servers were exceptionally kind to us and served us their traditional foods with a lot of joy and love. Our kids had a lot of fun at the pool and walking around the beach - the waters are quite rough and not suitable for swimming. We took a co-joint room and had lots of space and enough bed space for our large family. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much.  The hotel is a bit old and the carpets had a musty smell. Our toilets had some issues with plumbing. A bit pricey. "
pegasus-reef, 7.0 ,"Staff was friendly.  View from the room. But to be fair it was not their fault. I didn't ask for a Sea View room.
Also the in room dining menu needs to be improved "
pegasus-reef, 6.2 ,Breakfast needs a lot of improvement. Extremely unhygenic with flies swarming all over the bread area and desserts section. The staff isn't attentive enough to do anything about the issue. Dozens of flies sitting all the bread section and poorly maintained
pegasus-reef, 10 ,Cheers to shawn/sean who helped make our stay even more memorable! 
pegasus-reef, 4.6 ,"Fish restaurant Good for groups less good for families with kids
Too expensive compared to quality."
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"Very nice staff, good dinner at the restaurant of sea food, everything really clean "
pegasus-reef, 10 ,The property location is great. The rooms are in good condition and the breakfast was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel.
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,Extremely pleasant staff at the reception.  Everyone including other staff were keen to make sure that we had a good stay.  Updated rooms with good AC.
pegasus-reef, 9.6 ,"Pool was phenomenal. Big and beautiful. The grounds were gorgeous and well kept. One of the pool attendants was super nice and when just my daughter and I came down for breakfast in the morning, kne of the kitchen gentlemen said ""only the two of you this morning?"" And when I said that my husband was upstairs sick, he was quite concerned and offered to take him up some breakfast. Very kind and thoughtful. We were also granted a later checkout to better suit my sick husband. Nothing really!!!"
pegasus-reef, 4.6 ,"The only thing i like is the complimentary fruit basket Receptionist, Location, Overpriced, Too much weddings, When you go around beach 10-20 dogs will come to you, Crows and pigeons drinking water from the pool, Pool is too small and my room is double bed and they joined the 2 single beds. My phone skids between two beds. Overall not happy with the stay"
pegasus-reef, 5.4 ,"Location No mini bar
No beach swimming"
pegasus-reef, 3.3 ,"Staff were nice but very slow Over priced for a poorly maintained and ran down hotel. The location is shocking about 30-40min drive to Colombo when stated 10 mins online. We were supposed to stay for a week we left after a night, got a refund as they charged for the full stay on arrival. For the same price we stayed in an outstanding hotel in Colombo cit6 called the Marino beach."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"It was fantastic time in Kolombo (staff , swimingpool, breakfast ) Nothing"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,each and every services N/a
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,"Freindly, nice staff, accomodating. Checking in did take some time as counter did not have some forms ready."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,The garden with the pool is fantastic. Excellent housekeeping by Rinaz.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Staff was well prepared and took sensible measures against Corona before it got widespread in the country. Felt odd to see all staff wearing face masks and using hand sanitizer but good to see the hotel trying to take its' staff and guests' health seriously. Staff was helpful and courteous. 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,The bed was excellent the staff were excellent an very friendly Nothing realy
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"What didn't we like, from extremely high levels of customer service, really nothing too much trouble, Facilities available,  a wide range for all tastes, Extremely high food standards in the restaurants on site , Cleanliness in all areas, Great value for money I have sat long and hard and really there is nothing. On our second visit we had a room that overlooked a function area where a wedding was being held. This was our last night and we had a very early start. The band could be heard in our room,  BUT the music did stop before midnight. This is a hotel after all , \i feel that the interest of everyone was taken into consideration, I am sure that had we asked another room would have been made available but this was not a prsctical solution on this occasion."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"Absolutely loved it. The minute you enter you are made to feel special.
We were upgraded to the premium wing which was great.
The room and facilities were so good that I wanted to extend my stay. Nothin to dislike."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Perfect room, great location and the staff, particularly Kirthi, were fantastic. Kirthi made our trip extra special by going out of his way to make us feel welcome. Nothing."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Restaurants, good value, concierge arranged a driver for us, pool area Italian restaurant Echo was just ok - small portions."

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.8 ,"Did not have breakfast. Location is pretty good.Easy to get transport. Signage to pool is poor. Have to pass through restaurants and lobby to get to pool. Nuga Gama was not promoted to guests,"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"- Great location, friendly staff- Good rooms with clean and functional toilets with all ameneties- Good options for restaurants and pub- Nice large Gym with all amneties- I felt secure due to good security arrangements Nothing significant. Just that the temporary breakfast place can get crowded and service was lax. Had to send multiple reminders for things like coffee, water etc."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Everything Nothing that I disliked
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,The total arrangements are marvelous Nothing
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.3 ,"Nice hotel The service charges are more than 24% if the rate on booking.coThis is insane It is too muchYou suppose to give us a net cost and don’t just say that there will be extra service charges without saying how much that service charge will be"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"We sadly didn't get to really have breakfast, just some tea and fruit, but looked like a great spread from what we saw. The staff were great and the beds the most comfortable our whole trip. We were disappointed by the quality of the food from room service, a couple items we couldn't even eat. other than that hard to find anything to complain about...but wish we had used the pool"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"The staff was helpful, the location was good and the food was amazing check-out experience was honorable and thy had me waiting for more than an hour and yet didn't return the deposit back"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent location, Great Hotel. a must visit hotel in colombo Its not a dislike rather something the hotel can improve on . The restaurants food was great. The only issue was that the restaurant staff were not very helpful during the ordering. We always ended up over ordering due to that."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Great place, amazing staff. Separate thanks to London Grill waiters! Nothing "

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Spacious Room
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Don’t know how to start as the staff was super amazing and has done a perfect job to make my little trip the best ever and have made a perfect impression to come back again.As this was not our first hotel and we stayed in movenpic first I would totally recommend cinnamon.Check in was done and Rathanyake took our luggage and did a little orientation while escorting us to our room. Explained perfectly which restaurant is where and did also explain about the timings.Showed us the aminities and explained as well. Was really kind hearted, friendly and made a really great first impression of the hotel.Later I wanted to know the way to spa, jehan who was kind enough to escort me to spa with a small talk. Was really nice that he did not try to tell me go left and right but instead showed me the way. Throughout the stay he remembered my name and did always greet me with my name and asked me if everything is going good.I did love that while bringing a turndown the person asks if we are comfortable.I would like to also mention kumar and harry the two drivers are amazing and lalith from security who also talked while seeing me each time.Can’t thank enough for all the staff for being so kind and warm to us. The closes a bit too early"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"We really enjoyed the stay, but mostly Mr. Saladin who serves u in the executive lounge, is the man you must meet and have a chat. 🙌🏽"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Comfortable Supportive staff"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Variety of restaurants. Friendly Staff. Amazing ambiance!
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Staff are very helpful.Facilities are excellent.Location is great.Wide variety of restaurants. ""Noodles"" is a favourite, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful!"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Great hotel. Excellent in house pub with smoking area and good prices, good food, snacks and nachos. Very clean room, good service, excellent breakfast "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,almost everything..its simply grand.. nothing.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Location was ok excellent 
"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Excellent!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Pool has a beautiful location. Choices of food are immense. Rooms have everything you can ask for. Value for money in every sense. Room service could be faster. Choices for transport can be more (only offering Audi is too expensive).
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Every thing is great as i love That toilet doesn’t have muslin shower
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"Gorgeous hotel, comfortable room, excellent service. Nothing"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Got an upgrade for a family room
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Everything is great. From check-in process to check-out. There are plenty of restaurants in the hotel: Vietnamese, Chinese, Italian, Western, etc. Swimming pool is huge.  Gym with steam and sauna available.  There is also a mall beside the hotel. Real 5-star/luxury experience.   Toilets have no water pipes. You only use tissue. The hotel should put water pipes/hose for those who are not comfortable with just tissue. "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"The buffet breakfast was great and with lots of food choices. Especially the curry and spices was not as spicy as restaurant outside, just nice for those who couldn't tolerate spicy food like us. And the staffs at the hotel, from the front desk to house keeping as well as the in house restaurant and cafe, all were very helpful and friendly. I personally came for a postgraduate exam and my transportation to the exam destination had been arranged well and everything went on smoothly with the help of the staffs hotel. Basically everything was good and I don't see any rooms for complaints either."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.5 ,The atmosphere of foyer is amazing and the cake cafeteria was superb  The reception and the room dinning etc were not responding.  The room dinning was very expensive compared to the quality and quantity of food provided. Secondly the long walk to the rooms is not that amusing specially across the atrium 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.7 ,foods there are lots of cockroach inside the room we have told to the maintaince manager but no use we didt't expect this
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.1 ,"The breakfast area not convenient , it’s should be in GF or at lest have lift facilities. The lift also too old and slow speed .The dental kit , tooth brush was too hard not usable .Other thing is ok .The lobby was fantastic."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.2 ,Restaurant choices The air conditioning in my room did not get very cold and just circulated the air. The room was also dated compared to a colleagues. This was room 675.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 3.8 ,Not 5 star level.. not even 4 star
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 2.9 ,"Leaving Cinamon Grand was my favourite part. It is a very old hotel, it seems royal but it is not. Smell of fish and dirty water surrounds the outside of the hotel, pool is not enjoyable. Our bed smelt like someone had peed in it and the room itself smelt old and dirty. The overall functionality of the room is poor too, no power connections; we only had 1 in the whole room. The toilet is cramped and dirty. Its not worth the money. Too expensive for a very poor quality that it offers."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.1 ,"Need more trained staff during peak breakfast service, Place gets crowded and I felt the restaurant was understaffed. This is the first time I stayed with Cinnamon Grand, I normally stay at the Hilton. However, the service levels are comparable."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.5 ,Ambiance
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.1 ,Good place for a conference. Space
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.2 ,"We have stayed at the hotel at least once a year for more than a decade. At this point, especially considering the abundance of newer hotels from which to choose, CG feels tired and the service spotty at best. Housekeeping was particularly spotty with one excellent maid and others who were definitely not on point. We stayed 3 weeks so we had plenty of time to judge. If not for proximity to family, we would have stayed elsewhere."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 3.3 ,"Staff were rude and snobbish, during check in the card I had used to reserve the room was declined so we used a different one to make payment. After being shown our room an attendant was sent in to remove everything inside the mini bar. We stood and watched on as he placed everything in to a plastic bag, whilst explaining that the reception staff had told him to do so. It was extremely uncomfortable for both parties and we had literally been in the room for only a couple of minutes. The room was tired and shabby, with flaking paint and plug sockets which didn't work. We were glad to leave in the morning and would not recommend, definitely not what we would have expected from a 5 star hotel. Disgusting and rude behaviour from the staff who did not make us feel welcome."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.2 ,Good hotel.. especially for the price.. food was awesome and the staff were really helpful..  i will most probably visit again in the future.. Not enough parking spaces..
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.2 ,Good hospitality. Staff was friendly. Hot water was flowing perfectly.  The rooms in the ground floors can be improved a little more . 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,"We are not comfortable for facilities
"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.6 ,Fabulous breakfast n clean beach.friendly staff.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.6 ,"Room was excellent, food was good, really like the view from the room. We enjoyed our stay very much. Hard to control the A/C. Every time need to walk for the controler in the wall to adjust the a/c."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,Everything was perfect Before taking lunch we had to vacate the room
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.3 ,Some personal staff  Not single thing 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.3 ,"Arrived late with children and did not feel welcome at all while we waited over half an hour for check in. Maintenance work was carried out during the day, with a wedding event which meant guests were hanging around the hotel pool. hotel guests were moved to a dark banquet room for a make shift breakfast whilst wedding guests were given the restaurant over looking the beach were breakfast is usually held. 
On check out, nobody offered to help with our luggage and instead ran after us as we left, chasing for a bar tab that we had already paid. An unfriendly and over priced hotel. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,"Room was extra small, bathroom and the room is not clean and doesn't value for money. Doesn't have much variation in buffet."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,Beach No beach view as promised. Rooms were not cleaned.
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.2 ,"The view is amazing, absolutely worth the stay despite of the negatives The service wasnt as good, when I asked about the receipt one of the guy laughed very impolitely in my face, the breakfast took 2hours- but okay we probably should have said it a day early"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"This place is amazing!!!!
The house was lovely, everything has been made from the wood. From the balcony you can see the Nine Arch Bridge (10 minutes by walk). You can find a mosquitere set in the room. 
I read other opinions and I don’t agree with it. Our room was clean. We hadn’t ants there. If you would like to spend your time next to nature, we recommend this place! The bed is really comfortable, and we slept the best here.
We spent 14 days in Sri Lanka. During this trip we slept in hotels, guesthouses, tree houses in different standard. We had before lizards, ants, and another wasps. In the HideoutElla Wood Cabin we didn’t have any of them. 
The staff is very herpful! The breakfast was amazing!!!!! They have also a tuk tuk. 
Thanks guys!
We will back to you soon.
"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,The view. The hosts. The room. 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"Exceptional hospitality we were so well looked after pampered in fact in the most cosy and unique lodging in Ella. The infinity views over the mountains and valley are breathtaking. located overlooking the famous nine arch bridge, you can gaze watching the trains pass from your own private balcony. We absolutely loved our stay at HideoutElla Wood Cabins"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 7.0 ,The view 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 7.0 ,"Location and the view 
Friendly staff(Dhanush) Hot water shower doesn't work properly.. 
Lights also doesn't work properly. Because it suddenly switched on when we switched it off.. "
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 7.0 ,Everything  Nothing 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 1.0 ,"Amazing view from the balcony , nice stuff which tried to help us with everything we needed.  Nice tuk tuk driver who took us to the city and picked us up any time for just 400.  We had 2 sleepless nights because of rats in our room. Doors were closed but unfortunately they are able to come through the wood and through the roof. We saw them with our eyes and decided to move out at 5:30 in the morning because it was so huge und disgusting. The shower has a nice view but it’s a missconstruction because the water goes out everywhere. :( also the plants on the balcony are completely full of mildew. While the stuff we’re looking for the rat during the night we moved the bed and saw an old apple and water bottles underneath. Not nice to know that the room wasn’t cleaned. During the night it gets really cold there but the stuff have us a little thicker blanket so it was okay.
All in all on the first view it looks super nice but unfortunately it isn’t and it was the biggest disappointment on our holidays because we were so excited about the stay.
After a discussion via WhatsApp with the owner (who doesn’t live in Sri Lanka) we got even more mad. I told him that I am pretty sure that 95% of the world citizens don’t like to have rats in their room and I still believe in that. After that he called me a racist and he regrets to give me the room. But that’s not all !!! My friend wrote a bad but honest review for the room, after that we got a new WhatsApp during the night where he tried to ruin our holidays. He told us that the people after us were infected be the corona virus and they expect us to infect them. They have be quarantined for 14 days and he gave all our details to the health ministry and we have to cooperate now because we need to be quarantined as well. Of course we were frightened like hell ... we r still healthy , not infected and it wasn’t possible that we spread the virus and people got infected in one day, the virus came out on the same day, they got tested on the same day and then quarantined . Also at the airport on our way back home nothing happened, because it wasn’t true. If this happens after a bad review this is just shocking."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 6.2 ,It has a nice view of nine arch bridge. And the hammocks and the cabin was cute and nice place It’s bit small. Specially bathroom. The shower was too small because of that entire bathroom floor was always wet. Hot water not working properly. They didn’t give breakfast free for this amount. 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 7.0 ,the view! room was kind of clammy
taj-samudra, 10 ,The duty manager Mr Dananja had been very courteous and helped to make our stay very comfortable
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Location, staff knowledge, helpful, extremely helpful, ready to help with any query. The reception staff were very good with checking in checking out. Food was brilliant, delicious and lots of variety. We enjoyed our stay at Taj and can’t find a fault in any thing."
taj-samudra, 10 ,We stayed at the Club ocean view room & I must say everything was flawless. It was my husband’s birthday & they did everything possible to make us feel special. 
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"Club rooms & suites are spacious. Comfortable beds. Super spacious & well equipped gym.  Helpful & friendly staff Looks little dated in places.
Super slow service at the Chinese restaurant, Golden Dragon. "
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Everything else was perfect Room could have been bigger
taj-samudra, 10 ,Location and the staff.
taj-samudra, 10 ,The bed and welcome drink is very good The room is abit thin. You can hear people outside ehen they walk.
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Friendly and very professional staff. Very spacious, clean and well-equipped rooms. Excellent restaurant (tasty and wide array of dishes). Highly recommended!"
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"The rooms look exactly like in the picture. The staff at the check in were quite pleasant, and the manager was even there to greet us at the entrance upon arrival. We had personal check in in our rooms, a welcome drink, and the whole check in, as well as check out was very organized. The staff were super helpful and professional, and the customer care is pretty good. We even got complementary wine and fruits on our last day! Overall really good service. What was abit dissapointing was that the cleaners really didn't clean the rooms- at al. The just made the bed, that's all. The furniture were all full of dust, to the point you could literally see the dust. At the bathroom, they only changed the towels, but the bathtub was not cleaned from the time we used it. Rather unfortunate for such a lovely hotel."
taj-samudra, 6.0 ,"Location Although very well located and sitting on prime real estate, the hotel looks a little jaded, rooms worn out. Similarly the staff could be a bit more trained and receptive"
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,"Some of your staff members at hotel where we had our breakfast and dinner like Diganto, some other support staff and supervisors in the night shift. Buddi at the reception. A bit pricy. Rates are on the higher side."
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Food was excellent..!  Property and the room we got is quite old. Need a renovation. 
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Very good and smooth check in.Excellent hospitality, and breakfast spread.Very good south indian food . All was fine."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"The attention to detail was amazing. The rooms aren’t completely up to date, but that’s probably why they are inexpensive."
taj-samudra, 10 ,Everything was great
taj-samudra, 10 ,"The room was very clean and spacious with up-to-date amenities. The bed was very comfortable and the views of the ocean were great. We tried in-room dining as well as the restaurant ""port of call""; and the taste and food quality was excellent. The staff really goes out of their way and we had a wonderful stay.  "
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,Good selection of Indian food.
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,"Very central and great hospitality as always with taj, special mention of our floor supervisor Sunil jaywardana who went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable"
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,The location in front of the sea and it’s ambience authentic Indian style 
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,The staff were very sweet and friendly I couldn’t get an appointment at the spa.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Great service in the restaurants and especially the Recreation team. As we understood that there was no tennis court, Dinesh - manager pf Recreation team - created a tennis court on grass for us. 
Very nice kids club: the girls were great!!
A lot of entertaiment is organized by the Recreation team!! We tried to change our booking, but The reception people send us back to the broker: Booking.com, what we didn’t understand. We had to ask twice for an extra bed in our room.
Prices are overrated in all restaurants, although the Ulpatha was moderate and was cosier than the buffet restaurant. "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"Food wasn’t delicious.
"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,The best hotel you can chose if you are traveling with young children. The kids club and pools are insane! Our toddler was in paradise. You can also order nanny service for them if you wish to go to the gym or do a short excursion. The staff are the best we have ever seen! The food was outstanding and the selection was super generous. They also had a temporary elephant educational exhibit there which was super interesting and the guide was very knowledgeable. Would love to go back again one day! The spa had no nail technician as she was in holidays for which I think they should have a replacement as it was high season. Archery lessons was a downfall. They only had the bow for men so women cannot participate and the instructor was in a rush to finish the class and was not very knowledgeable.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything was perfect  Varity of food
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 6.0 ,Buffet was not well arranged due to less no of  guests. Buffet is not  worthy for the price. arrangements were not prepared as requested.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 6.0 ,The buffet was not enough and for the value we paid a very small range of food. There can be buffets half of the price but a wide range of food
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 6.0 ,Beautiful property that the hotel sits on.  Fairly over priced for items such as water and drinks. Most of bars / restaurants were closed throughout the stay including the pool bar so we ended up eating in the same one for breakfast & dinner. 
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 5.0 ,"We enjoyed the choice of pools, attentiveness of the restaurant manager in particular (name escapes me now) and the quality of our bedroom.  I fear that with the coronavirus, this hotel suffered.
There was no ambience, annoying water aerobics for 2 people at most and the food at the buffet was quite poor. It was clear they were recycling pork in particular from the days, and I actually got quite sick from it. I am going to form a formal complaint regarding the food and expense in the buffet as I didn’t think this was of good quality or to the standard I would expect at Shangri-la. "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 7.0 ,breakfast was good however they could have had some more variety on different days had a real issue on the security at the main gate which was illogical and made guests who had gone for a day trip wait for 20 minutes while a fully loaded bus was being checked and the worst was they were not willing to agree that they could relook at the procedure and simply said this was bad luck
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 4.0 ,"Swimming pool and kids club were great as the kids were occupied. Beach couldn't be used. Too remote and isolated. Not value for money at all, considering the rates for locals were significantly less than what we paid. We were disappointed as the hotel was inflexible to change our board from B&B to half board, considering there was nowhere else to go outside to eat."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,"Amazing food!!  Some really delicious huge meals here.  Great place to relax for a day.  Lots of hammocks around the gardens.  They will cook breakfast, lunch and dinner here for you.  They also have beer.  They organised our safari for us.  Our driver was determined to find a leopard for us and he succeeded. Power outages (by no fault of the staff.  I think it was from New Years celebrations)
Room had windows without screens - lots of insects and mosquitoes."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.1 ,"The dinner was very good.
The lake view and the hammocks. 
You can have a bike for free. After the booking they contact you via WhatsApp and they told you that you have to arrange the safari with their agency. Otherwise they ask you to cancel the reservation. I didn't like at all this way, but I accepted just to avoid looking for another accomodation in the last minute. The safari was awful (Jeeps traffic jam to see a leopard which we didn't see. Really more jeeps than animals). Anyway I cannot say if with other agency it could have been better).
There is no restaurants or shops around and they don't offer you anything when you arrive, not even water. When I ask for a bottle, I got a warm one (which for sure I paid).
The room was extremely hot.
The breakfast to take away for the safari was horrible (just a few sweet things).
There are constructions around."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 5.8 ,"The staff was very friendly, always smiled, however, it is more of a home stay than a hotel/hostel or lodge. The room did not have basic facilities like glass & water bottle. Also, the room was dirty, floor mats were so dirty that wiping legs would make  legs more dirty. The place had lot of mosquito breeding ground like dirty aquarium. 
When it rained at night, the roof leaked and 1/4 of the adjacent bed got wet. 
The breakfast was severely disappointing and tasteless."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.1 ,"The cabanas was a great size and had big comfortable beds with much needed mosquito nets. The location by the lake was perfect and we felt right at home with nature. We really enjoyed walking round the lake after a long morning safari. We ate lunch there and the food was delicious with huge portions. The hotel organised a safari for us with a good driver, though there were some downsides. Cold shower. Our cabanas was next to the family home, which was noisy throughout the day. It was also difficult to know who to ask for help and felt like we were intruding when finding someone - a bell would be helpful.
We felt pressured to get a safari with the hotel, and think if we had looked around we would have got a better price. For the higher price we expected a better service, so was disappointed by one pair of broken binoculars for two people and a minimal breakfast.  "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,"Next to Lake with buffalos wading close by.  Cheap with good basic food. Very helpful and always smiling. Meals  adequate. 
Would go back again.  Top people always smiling and helpful. 
 Primitive bungalow on stilts and poor lighting but our stay was made happy by very nice people who went out of their way to assist. Highly recommended. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,"A nice family cabana with view over the swamp (it is not really a lake). It is very opened, easy for animals to get inside, but if was animal free, luckily ;-)  Comfortable large beds with moscitonet. Great for a family of four. The service is ok. Long wait for breakfast and dinner. We booked the safari with them, which was nice, but the guide was not at all serviceminded."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 2.5 ,"Nothing Nothing about this property is good. It is run by a bunch of thugs whose sole intention is to squeeze as much money as possible from innocent tourists.
And very important Booking.com deserves a serious   rap on their knuckles for promoting this unsafe and dangerous property.
I had booked a lake side cabana cottage for two nights for self, wife and my seven year old daughter. The property tried to sell its safari @ 36 USD per head i.e. 108 USD (LKR 19764) on a shared vehicle.  I declined the same as I could book the same on a complete vehicle to myself at LKR 15500 from another guy in the town.
As soon as the property learnt of this, it started creating problems. The first was that the booking was only for two adults and children was not included. Hence, I was told to pay an amount of USD 90 as against  USD 68 for two nights. When I protested, the property informed me that their prices varied every day and they would charge based on what they felt like. It soon dawned upon me that I was helpless and therefore I agreed to pay USD 90.
Now comes the real part. After I agreed to pay USD 90, the property alloted me a double room cottage instead of a lake side cabana. The lake side cabana had already been sold to some other people. When I protested ,  I was threatened with dire consequences and therefore decided not to pursue the   thing further.
The room alloted to me had no facility. It was dirty with no amenities. All toiletries other than soap were missing. The sink and commode were dirty. The kettle and glasses provided were  very dirty. Moreover, there was fabrication in progress adjacent to my hotel room and there was loud noise till late in the night  which prevented me from sleeping.
Booking.com needs.to seriously think about its booking policy w.r.t booking in another country  as far as safety of tourists is concerned.
The last thing is about the bills. Payment is demanded in cash and the receipt given without any details of property."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 3.8 ,"Dinner was amazing, Sri Lankan style a whole variety of different tasty curries, desert and fruits. The breakfast prepared for Safari was fine. Close to a lake, we could see the buffalos from the garden.
We got a free ride to the bus station. You probably went to Tissamaharama for a Safari tour like us. By the time we got to Tissa we already had an appointment with another agency but the hotel forced us to go on the Safari with them. They told us if we don't go on they're Safari we would pay double the room price (17$x2) or they can look for another hotel. Luckily we didn't pay any advance to the online appointment so we cancelled it. 
Anyway we went on they're Safari and the driver asked us to pay 6500rupee/person whilst everyone else in the car paid 6000 (we knew this just because we discussed about the prices with the others doing the Safari). When I asked the driver why do we have to pay more he said: ,,ask your hotel''. At the end of the trip the driver return to me the extra money and made it look like a favor. We didn't want any favors, we just wanted to pay a fair price like everybody else.
-location is very remote, 30 min walking to the closest restaurant
-there were 2 snakes roaming around freely on the property and the girl of the owners just said they are not dangerous
-we had lizards in our room (at some point I counted 5 lizards in the room, on the walls)
-there's a church nearby who were doing the service during the whole night and the room had no windows so you could hear the prayers all night. We literally got less than 2h of sleep. To the hotel owners: if you knew the church were doing the service during the night and you are located so close to them why did you still book the rooms ?
"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,"Very helpful staff.  Lovely setting. Food very good. Its located quite far out and road bit bad. Please put a small bin."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 5.8 ,"It was not as we expected, we thought we would be staying in a cabana as advertised but because there were only 2 cabanas we we put in a brick building, which was disappointing.
Suitable more for people backpacking.
We wanted a jungle experience but not quite that isolated or small."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 5.0 ,Beautiful romantic please. We are guaranteed nice experience. Green Agro farm kandy private limited.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 5.0 ,"Bindu, the driver on my safari was absolutely a treasure. It was very rustic. My cabana was very open with slat windows and gaping spaces. I huddled under my mosquito net and wondered what all the sounds were. Not sure what ate part of my banana. It is also very dark around the site so taking a flashlight is important. There is no lock to secure the cabana while you are gone all day. Food can be provided on site but no menu is available."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,"We had dinner at the property, which was huge and deicious. The hosts were very nice and friendly. 
The location at the lake is nice, you can watch water buffaloes, birds,.. If you are afraid of animals such as spiders, mice or snakes, this property is not for you- all of these animals we have seen there, though I liked the experience. 
The Safari the hosts organized for us at Yala unfortunately was not convincing. The driver new hardly any English and therefore communication was complicated. The complete Safari felt more like a hunt for the animals rather than watching them chilled in their natural habitat. Though I think that this is a general problem at Yala as it’s completely overrun. We also did a Safari at Udawalawe which we enjoyed much more. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,The lady was fairly nice and the rooms are a good size and the price is obviously reasonably good but I don’t understand the exceptionally high score.  Didn’t feel particularly welcome and felt we had to ask. Just poor communication and not a great first impression really.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.5 ,"The setting is lovely and the room is clean and spacious. At times it was somewhat difficult to communicate with the staff. For example, when we would ask for a drink or food the staff would disappear and we wouldn't know what was happening. Also, in order to stay at the property  you have to organise the safari through them, which appears to be at a higher cost. This is fine as the cost of the stay is very low, but keep in mind that the property is quite a far away from Yala."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 6.7 ,"- treehouse stay experience
 - well, u are in the wild. Expect a lot of cricket sounds at nite. Difficult to sleep
- NOTE: if you want to go to Yala National Park, you hav to book the tour with them (see my tips with regards to this) 
- hot shower but water pressure v low"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 2.0 ,"The tree houses look great from the outside, and generally it's a good idea, but it's poorly executed.The owners are really nice people, food they serve is tasty. There was so much damp in my house that it was literally impossible to stay there. The mattress, pillows and the sheets were literally wet. It was impossible to sleep in that bed. And don't get me started on the smell, so much mustiness I couldn't breathe.There are no glass panes in the windows, which means that bugs and insects come into the house as they please.No hot water."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 6.7 ,"Beautiful property, charming wooden bungalow, magical setting, the woman who co-owns the property was charming.  The guesthouse required us to join their safari tour in order to stay there. The driver and ""guide"" - who I believe is the co-owner of the property - were surly and disinterested, not even bothering to introduce themselves on our lengthy safari to Yala National Park. At one stage they parked the car in a random location for so long our guide appeared to doze off. The vehicle itself was not a proper safari vehicle, and it was uncomfortable and difficult to try and look for animals. Food at the guesthouse was tasty but overpriced for what it was."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 6.7 ,"Room is big and has hot water.  If you do not want their safari you should cancel it (their words). From the morning people were doing some works near and under the house. Loud music until 2am. Btw only one house has view on the lake, but they promote it that all have. 
Safari: we booked whole day. Not worth it. Definitely go just for half day. Around lunch and after you see nothing more. It is crowded even during september. We saw 1 leopard and at that time there was around 30 jeeps around him and it was crazy and not nice. There are no elephants inside national park. We saw some around 10 km from entrance on the road where people feed them from cars so you do not have to pay for that. If you like animals and nature do not go to yala at all.
We have food allergy and they gave us breakfast for safari which we could not eat even when we told them about it.
Guide/driver do not care too much. We were driving around park via same route, then he sometimes stopped and told us that sometimes there are animals. He then took a nap and if we do not wake him up he would sleep much longer. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 5.0 ,Friendly people.  Shower head was so clogged it just dribbled. Not the cleanest of places. Too many bugs but you have to expect that in the location. Bed mattress in need of renewal. 
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,Incredible location and really different kind of accommodation. Views over the lake and hammocks to chill out in. The owner’s daughter did all the customer service and she was incredible. Dinner was homemade and was delicious and so cheap! We got to eat outside with other guests. Nothing was too much trouble.   Not a lot really! If I had to pick something- the shower was cold (but it is a tree house!). 
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The view - AMAZING!
(And the tranquility) Not much"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Really nice cabanas in a beautiful surrounding next to the lake. Amazing family and very great home-cooked dinner! Brilliant safari with a very experienced driver. On our departure the host even dropped us off at the bus stop.
Best accomodation if you want to do a safari in Yala National Park!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We had an amazing time here - beautiful gardens by the lake, delicious dinners and a wonderful family. Thank you so much for such a relaxing time. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Very nice place, good food, nice owners. -"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Fantastic experience - treehouse cabana right on beautiful lake. Accommodation is like a tropical garden. Family owned, extremely nice and warm people. Home cooking. Early morning (6AM) on the shore of the lake is like being in paradise. Nothing really."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"One of the most  beautiful places we stayed during our trip!! The wildlife, atmosphere and surroundings and the kind family are just amazing! A really nice place to relax and just enjoy nature. The cabana was spacious and as clean as could be. Great dinner! The breakfast was good but we had a richer one in other places. In the evening there were many Moskitos but I guess that's nothing to complain about if you want to stay at the side of a lake. And they even lit those things against mosquitos for us which was very nice."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"It is a great idea if you staying there. Little bit out from the cuty, but its good for relaaxing. And there safari also great and we saw 6 leopards in the fullday tour. They have a little fridge in the safari jeep. It was goo as in the national park was too much hot. Must say they must have more rooms. I stay there only one day and i wanted to stay another night. But they are fully booked."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Beautiful cabana's, very clean, lovely surroundings, the family is simply amazing. The food is delicious. A perfect stay, we would recommend it to everyone! "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"Family cabana was great , clean , spacious .  Location is a bit out of no where ,  need transportation in and out . "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,Nice surroundings with clean natural environment.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,The treehouse was amazing
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,Such a lovely place to stay
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The place is run by a very nice and welcoming family. The cabanas are right at the lake and the views are amazing. There are many different kinds of birds. The cabanas themselves are basic but good, clean, very spacious and private. The family has their own jeep that they use for safaris. It's comfortable and their guide is very knowledgeable. We took a safari to Bundala, which was great and much more quiet than Yala. They have bikes for exploring the surroundings.  There is not much to do in the near surroundings, but it's beautiful and peaceful, so we still wished we could have stayed longer. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"This place really is a bird watcher's paradise. We stayed in the cabanna that overlooked the lake and it was a beautiful glamping experience. So relaxing just listening to the birds and turtles, watching fire flies and the morning sun rise over the lake. The owner organised a safari for us with a very knowledgeable driver. The food is excellent and the lady speaks very good English. You can borrow the owner's bikes and take a ride around the lake. Highly recommended - you'll miss out on a treat if you don't stay here!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Lovely little house!!! Very privateer and VERY big! The owners are super nice and provide you with help! We took the safari with two other girls that stayed there and had a really fun time! Saw elephants, leopards, crocodiles... 
The surroundings are really beautiful and there is a lake just in front which is really nice!  Sometimes there would be too many mosquitoes but at night you have the net so that helps! And the doors didn’t shut properly in the bathroom and outside, but it’s an easy problem to fix if you change the locks. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"great place to stay, beautiful scenery, very spacious room, lovely hosts, book it!!! "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Heaven on earth! The cottage is perfect and has a magnificant and overwhelming view. A friend of my had his birthday during our stay and the fantastic staff helped us organizing a memorable evening. Would recommend this stay to everyone! :-) This spot is quite hard to find (also for the tuctuc driver). It is advised to download a map in order to guide the tuctuc driver to your stay.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"If you are looking for a unique location in beautiful Srilankan nature, don't miss this one! Not only is one of the cabana's created in a special treehouse in the garden, also you can spot many birds (white herons, kingfishers, woodpeckers) and water-buffalo's in the lake from your terrace. Moreover the couple managing the guesthouse are so friendly that you would wish they were your own family! They can arrange your safari visit to Yala park, by contacting you to a very experienced guide (leopards spotted!). Note: the location is very rural! However, homemade Srilankan curry is available and excellent!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,This property is a perfect place to stay when you're in the area. The hosts (family) were very hospitable. I was treated like a king...literally. They attend to your needs immediately and they cook for you if you need some food. Not to mention the cabana was amazing! Will stay again when I visit the place. Recommended! Zilch.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Good location with a nice athmosphere just outside of Tissa. Perfect if you are looking for a quiet place close to the nature. The cabins was charming, clean and comfortable. Good food, both lunch and dinner. In the evening we borrowed bicycles for free and got a fun trip around the lake passing water buffaloes, crocodiles and lots of birds. They also arranged safari for us, half day tour starting 4 am - back at noon. The host family is welcoming and helpful.  The breakfast we got at the safari was very basic and not a lot, taking in to consideration that you are away for 8 hours. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We had an amazing stay - and so so loved being able to use the bikes and fishing rods
- and even managed to catch 2 fish from the lake. It was lovely to just hang out for a couple of days and were made to feel really at home. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"Very friendly family. Offer you thea in the afternoon and dinner was delicious! Made the best Curry.You can take the bikes for free and they offered us a ride to the village to take the bus."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Lake Side Cabana. The accommodation was lovely, the owners were amazing and extremely helpful and the lake was stunning. They organised a safari and even drove us to our next guest house. Would love to come back. Also, the food was the best we’ve had in Sri Lanka. 
Would definitely recommend this accommodation and that you have dinner there too! "

lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"- the family is just amazing. It felt like home from the first moment 
- you get very good local food for dinner, lunch and breakfast. We got different meals each day. 
- you can do a safari by yourself in the “garden”. Just beautiful and lots of animals. Just next to it is a beautiful lake.
- they organized safaris and transportation for a good price very quick  
- if you have enough time enjoy the garden and drink coconut water from the tree above you. 
- basic but very comfortable cabana with a view on the lake in the middle of the nature.  We did not care but consider that you don’t have AC"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The room is really nice : huge bed and so comfortable : one of your best sleep in Sri Lanka ! One of the best rice and curry as well :)I would definitely recommend this place :) It just miss a little bit of light in the room at night :)"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,A great place. Sleeping on a wooden cabana is such an expireance. The best stay in out trip. Amazing. A lot of noise cause of the birds. But it's a good thing.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Wonderful safari housing close to a small lake. Family is very nice and helpful. Took us to the busstation. Place is claming and relaxing. Visit the natural pool!!! The breakfast could have been slighty more or of sri lankan type
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Everything else! Great hospitality, was made to feel very welcome. The cabanas are fab - and all hand built in locally sourced materials (from the surrounding jungle) by family and friends.  Only issue was that it's not well known amongst local tuk tuk drivers and the location/address isn't correct on Google maps. If you're arriving late, get the driver to speak to the host or request a pin drop on Whatsapp"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"I can not say enough good things about this place. It’s an angle of paradise. They organised my safari for a very reasonable price, dinner was delicious, so much food. I felt very welcomed and the people working there were absolutely lovely!!"

Thank to all family for our five wonderfull days. See above"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,Nice and helpful staff. They offered safari (80usd per 2 person). Safari was great. We woke up at 4 am and about 11:30 am we came back to the acommodation. Driver knew only about 10 english words but ride was ok :-D
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"This place is an amazing little hideaway with lovely surroundings. We stayed in the tree house and had the best view over the lake, watching water buffalo cross the lake. The beds were super comfy and it was a novelty for my children to stay in an actual tree house. The food was great and the family lovely, always smiling!. My girls loved their pet rabbits they had in the grounds. We took the safari which was also fab, we did half a day which was enough for our 2 daughters. Definitely recommend"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"Owner were very friendly! The safari tour was amazing, our driver was very good, safe and respectful towards the animals. We would definitely do it again with them.
The room was spacious and everything was fine. would stay again here if you want to go on a safari tour."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We had this cabin by the lake, like from a fairytale. You can drink your tea while watching the sunrise over the lake in the lucious garden, there's plenty of birds coming from the water, we felt like we were living in the middle of nature. Also they cook delicious local food. It was perfect:)"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Wow! We had such a wonderful stay at LakeSide Cabana. The location is wonderful. It is surrounded by a very pretty lake, jungle and trees. We slept very good listening to the jungle. They had bikes for free so we could explore the surrounding, which is so beautiful. They arranged everything for a perfect Safari with breakfast and a nice driver. The food was amazing. We loved to stay here, felt so welcomed by the nice family and definitely recommend to stay here."

lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The place is like a little farm, the cabin is big/clean with a terrace, I wished the tree house was available during my stay. The owners are very nice and helpful."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,We stayed in the Cabana with a beautiful lakeview. The cabana is clean and cosy. The environment is very beautiful. I regret having stayed only one night! The host is super friendly. She prepared some lovely lunch and diner! She speaks very good English. Nothing is too much for her.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"Great location in the jungle by the lake, perfect for nature lovers!
Very nice staff"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Eco friendly, green, comfortable, special... the most amazing safari ever! The guys really know the park and the animals. We saw 4 leopards and a baby leopard, many many birds, elephants... it was a very good day! Ahhh and the food oh my god :) best in Sri Lanka"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Location, facilities, host..everything was just super! Dhanushka was so nice and helpful. Especially her cooking. Best food I had in Sri Lanka. Her parents were great too. This place is highly recommended. like everything."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,"The best and most value-for-money meals that I had at their restaurant. Excellent food. Hosts were always smiling. The safari we arranged through the hotel (the vehicle was their own property, and driver was from one of their neighbours) was excellent and exceeded expectations from all angles. Hotel had packed a sumptuous breakfast, we saw plenty of game courtesy to the quick eyes of our driver, safari price was again value-for-money. The hotel is located a little inside the locality and GPS connection can be very slow. Told the owners of providing a route map to the hotel (showing lanes and by-lanes which may not be clear from google maps). Also we were travelling with kids, and all the luggage could not fit inside the cabin (we were staying at the cabin). However there is an excellent adjacent terrace which we could utilize."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"It was in a beautiful location, a really nice place to stop before a tiring yala safari. The safari they organised was run really well, the guy tried so hard to show us as much as he could and was in general pretty respectful of the animals - which was the most important thing for us! The food was amazing- so much of it as well and the daughter of the owners took us on a long walk to show us the way to a swimming river to make sure we'd find our way back safely. All in all a great stay ! The only problem we had was there was some music playing at night, I think they were having a bit of a party that day.  I also would recommend they move the hammocks from underneath the coconut trees as that could be a bit dangerous if one fell on someone."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Beautiful place, good price, Great family!absolutely recommended! "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Great place to stay. Very welcoming and the dinner was good. Also were very helpful and organised Yala safari.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"They looked after us so well, picked us up sorted out the safari and fed us great food... what more could be ask for, for £8! The cabana was really cool and a nice peaceful place to stay."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"The view from our cabin was absolutely fantastic, best we had on our whole trip. 
The owners were lovely people who went out do their way to make sure we were conformable.
They provided us with three very very good meals each day of our stay for an almost negligible cost.
Safaris to both Bundala and Yala were arranged by the hotel at reasonable costs with good drivers, as well as our transport back to Colombo airport on our departure day.  The chants from the local Buddhist temple that continued through the entire night for the final night of our stay. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"It was a fairy tale ! It was stunning, the color of the trees, the birds, the staff which were extremely nice. It was quiet and we herd a lot of birds. Since it’s in a tree you will find a lot of bugs inside. They, however,  put a net on top of the bed so they won’t bother you at night. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"- Perfect lake view with birds in surrounding. 
- Owners are realy trying to let you feel welcome
- Fish Aquaria
- Nice dinner
- Decent price for tours in Yala National Parc
- Cabana overviewing the lake are a must
- Free bike ride around the lake with a zillion birds and interaction with local kuds
- They try to be ecofriendly
- Familyrun
- They have musquito repellent - Sheets should be bigger for people above 180 centimetre"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Everything Nothing
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Everything was perfect: the place, the view on the lake, the food, the Safari to Yala and the hospitality of the hosts.Thanks to Danoushka and her husband.We will be back for sure."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Great place, great people. Wonderful view of the lake and the birds on it."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"The area is stunning..we saw our first crocodile in the lake..the family were superbly welcoming with great personality! Cabana was perfect, clean, great position, so many thing frequent the garden, we saw a beautiful giant squirrel before breakfast..along with parakeets and orials! Bargain price! There wasn't a thing we didn't like 😄"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Best food in sri lanka so far! Portions are insane, has bikes to cycle around the lake. Badminton was a highlight. All in all, amazing location, amazing people and an amazing time!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,"Great people, very nice and good food. When it rained, the owner brought us by car to the next village, very nice"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Absolutely amazing place! Cabins and garden are perfect for relaxing, food was really good and the owners / staff are super nice and helpful. They also organized my yala safari (both price and value were good) :-) 
100% recommendation!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,"Fab location 
Lent us bikes to cycle around town
Organized safaris for us
Great at emailing and answering questions The cabana had open windows - ie no glass in them. Which wasn’t a massive problem but worth knowing"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,"Very nice people, good food, good safari price with experienced driver possible. Allday or half day safari. Beautiful surroundings. Cheap. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Each cabin had its own balcony/outdoor space where you could sit and relax. 
It was a peaceful setting, well out of Tissa with a beautiful garden and view over the lake. 
All the staff were very friendly. The dinner was excellent and they had cold water and beer available. 
The room (ours was the family room) was spacious as was the bathroom, which had a hot shower! 
They arranged a morning safari to Yala for us, which was at a decent rate compared to others in our truck.  The lighting in our room could have been better but this wasn’t a big problem. 
Our breakfast for safari wasn’t to our taste (fried egg sandwiches) but this is personal thing and dinner was excellent. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The beds were super comfy (real sprung mattresses!), and the room on stilts we had was perfect - open and breezy but with mozzie nets - and looked out from the balcony over a small wetland full of birds. The bathroom was spacious and had hot water. The grounds are lovely with trees, flowers, fish tanks and ponds, as well as hammocks and other places to sit. Our kids loved playing with the bunnies and with the little boy who lives there. Our hosts - Danushka and her family - are kind and friendly and hospitable, and luckily provided fantastic, home-cooked Sri Lankan meals, as the cabanas are out of town, in the peace of the countryside. We booked a safari through them as well, and that went perfectly as well (in fact ,we booked two and then cancelled one because our kids were exhausted, and there were no problems with that either). This was definitely one of our favourite stays in Sri Lanka, and I highly recommend it."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We arrived late but they made dinner for us and had everything ready for our 4am safari the next morning.  The food was amazing, can’t go wrong with some grilled fish from the lake.  We had a great time here, just a shame it was only for two nights.  We really recommend this place for singles or couples. The only thing that is very minor is that the internet doesn’t reach the cabins, but it’s really not an issue."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"The lake side view and bird life was exceptional, we sadly missed the crocodile evening visit.The experience far exceeded the initial arrival, a nature lovers location.Food and juices, right down to the barbecued lake fish was amazing and very child friendly.We loved our stay. The shower drain location was away from the shower so bathroom floor was wet after showering. A relatively easy fix, and would not stop us from staying again."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"- The host family is very friendly.
- The Cabana was clean and comfortable for 4 persons.
- The place has a beautiful garden and offered many places to relax (hammocks).
- They organized the whole day safari (9500 LKR) at yala national park for us and it was amazing. The guide Manju was very experienced and patient and brought us to the right places in time, so that we saw five leopards (!) including a baby and an elephant family (among many other animals).
- The breakfast was tasty and tradional food.
- The dinner (5$ per person) was also tradional food and very delicious! (fruits, rice & curry and grilled fish from the lake) We weren't able to eat erverything. - We got a message after booking that we only can make a safari, if we book it with them. They said, they had bad experiences with other safari guys. Felt a bit strange."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,Great little Cabins right on the lake. The place is ran by a lovely couple. They scheduled our safari and even gave us a camera to take pictures with. The garden is beautiful and has ple ty of hammocks and seating areas to hang out. The rooms were absolutely wonderful and the beds some of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. Over all we had a great time! 
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,Very friendly personnel! Good dinner. The Yala National Park is very touristic but worth a visit. Didn't like the fact that we had to book the Yala safari via the accomodation.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"location

lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"The setting is absolutely stunning! Beautiful lake and garden where something is happening all the time... We saw so many birds and also monitor lizards! The cabin is remarkably clean and bug-free, given the location in the middle of nature. We could hire some bikes for free (!) to make a tour around the lake, highly recommend! Dinner was nicely set up as well.  Only one of the cabins has full view of the lake. The one we booked was family cabana, which is at the lake but doesn't really look out on the lake, more on the garden. 
No welcome drink (unlike all other places in sri Lanka we went)"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"I stayed specifically for a yala tour. Within minutes of booking for the cottage, i'd also got booked on a safari which was great! I arrived too early for check-in but the staff made me feel really welcome, made me breakfast (free of charge) and let me chill in the hammock. The view of the lake and the gardens are beautiful, and the cottage was really comfortable! Sadly, i only had 1 day planned for yala otherwise i would have just stayed for a few days chilling in the hammock enjoying the gardens and the view. Upon leaving the stafg arranged a tuk tuk for me to ella. The whole stay just felt easy!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The place, as the name suggests, is beside a lake, with lots of greenery. Mini ponds, aquariums and lots of birds make it a delightful experience. The hammocks are a good place to spend an evening with a book or to just take a nap. We entered Lakeside Cabana to the sight of peacocks roaming the grounds and hundreds of other birds chirping in the trees and we knew we'd made the right decision by staying here. Our ride to town was punctuated by monitor lizards on the roadside and even a star turtle crossing the road!
The staff here is friendly, without being intrusive. They even lent us their scooter when we needed to ride to town for the ATM and couldn't find a tuktuk. The safari was a great experience - we got to see a leopard snoozing under a tree, and the driver was friendly, knowledgeable and good with the vehicle. 
In all a great experience. Would definitely stay here again!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"This property is in a stunning location on the lake. We arrived midday and were able to enjoy watching the water buffalos cross the lake together, spotting crocodiles, and lounging in the hammocks while a giant lizard crossed the garden! The cabana itself was clean and comfortable equipped with a fan and a mosquito net. We had a delicious curry dinner served with incredible buffalo yogurt and honey for dessert. Our trip was very fast paced, so we only stayed one night. This meant leaving early in the morning for our safari, so we had the safari breakfast instead of the breakfast at the property. We were allowed to leave our things in the cabana and check our after our safari so that we could shower before we left. I thought that was wonderful. I would highly recommend staying more than one night if time allows. Everything was wonderful."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We loved our lake side Cabana, it was so beautiful and really felt like we were in a tree house! The family running the place were lovely and super helpful in every way. All the meals were excellent, especially dinner! This place has the coolest vibe. Definitely book the safari through this place! We had the best experience at Yala, our drivers were amazing!!!!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Beautiful surroundings. Host got in contact with us before the stay and helped us to book an amazing Safari at Yala National Park. Also the host took us a to a village festival which was awesome. We ate dinner at the place too. It was delicious, we even had a bon fire. Love it and would book it again!  Nothing to complain about :) "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"The cabin was beautifully rustic and set right on the lakeside with views over the water. A perfect location, especially at sunset and sunrise. The lake is teeming with birds and dragonflies (as well as a friendly local crocodile). Beds were large and comfortable, staff friendly and incredibly helpful and the food was amongst the best I've eaten in Sri Lanka. Overall it was probably my favourite Sri Lankan accomodation and incredible value for money. I would love to stay again!  Personally I loved it all but some might take issue with the fact that there was no lock on the door of the cabin and that you are effectively open to the world and its mosquitoes as the windows are not sealed (although the beds are equipped with effective mosquiro nets and we didn't really get bitten in the room)."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.9 ,"Very relaxed and friendly staff. The cabana is great, big lovely beds and big bathroom. A family run business, located by the lake about 10 min tuk-tuk ride from Tissa. They serve food after their choice, not a restaurant - but good food.One has to take the whole package, hotel, food and safari."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,Very relaxing and tranquil spot! Able to check in early and lay in the gorgeous hammocks. Delicious food and lovely staff! A little drive to the park and ate all meals at the guesthouse. Very helpful with taxis to our next location
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"I came and stayed at the lakeside cabanas with my partner so we could visit Yala National Park and do a day safari. We stayed two nights and it was the best two nights accomodation we’ve had since travelling Sri Lanka for a month. As soon as we arrived we were shown to our cabana which overlooked the lake and was so incredibly beautiful it felt like something out of the movies. We arrived in the evening and had no problem what so ever booking a safari for early in the morning. On our safari we were provided a packed breakfast, fruits and water. We were able to see all the animals during our safari including the spotted leopard up close thanks to the excellent guide and driver. It was also so much cheaper than other places and is run totally by the family who genuinely really care about your experience. The food we had here was amazing! For $5 each we were given an absolute feast for dinner of Sri Lankan rice and curry, drinks, fruit and some local buffalo yoghurt for dessert (don’t knock it till you try it). In the afternoon after our safari the family took my partner and I in their Jeep to the local river to cool off for the afternoon. This was such a cool experience and they also stopped off to show us around some of the things in their village such as the dam which was built in 1860! Overall our stay at the lakeside cabanas was absolute incredible. We were blown away by every single aspect, the food, the family, the hospitality, the location, the room and of course the safari! The family all work together and go out of their way to ensure you are having the best possible stay and they are so kind. I know they have been having some trouble with false reviews which are being left by fake accounts from other locals trying to steal their business and it ended up with their trip advisor account (with over 500 5 star reviews) being suspended. Please ignore these and take it from us you WILL NOT be disappointed by staying and safari-ing here!!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,We just loved our bungalow with lakeview. The familie was more than friendly and very helpful. Food was great too. They can also organize great safari trips. Unfortunately we could only stay two nights.... Highly recommended! Best stay at Sri Lanka for us.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"If you like nature, and hustle free travel definitely, this one!!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"The owners were so lovely, they drove us into town to get some money from an ATM and waited for us in their car whilst we nipped into the supermarket. Our dinner was so so nice on our first night, the tables were set and there was music on with a fire burning.
The site itself was so lovely, was so nice to chill on a hammock listening to the birds. The safari arranged by them was also really really good. We booked the full day tour which is a long day but was worth it because we saw all the animals that we wanted to see! Owners gave us insect repellent.  Our cabana was far too open, at one point there was 4 frogs in our room. It was difficult to sleep as there was flies everywhere even with the mosquito net around the bed. The WiFi didn’t reach our room. Other than this we had a really nice stay. Thank you! "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.9 ,"Cool ""treehouses"" with great view of the lake.  The ""all-inclusive"" package is totally worth it for safari, room, and board.  Enormous and tasty meals.  Safari was fantastically done! Open-air cabins become infested with bugs at night.  Mosquito nets helped, but floor and outside deck crawling with red ants, spiders, etc.  Animals at night and school next door early in the morning are loud."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We loved everything about Lakeside Cabana, from the cleanliness of the room to the ambience. The staff were amazing and made our stay very special. Nothing was too much trouble and they went above and beyond to ensure we not only had a comfortable stay, but that we felt right at home. We enquired about a cooking class having missed an opportunity in Ella and they recommended a local one, however also offered for us to watch them cook the evening meals for the guests. We decided to watch them cook and ended up staying for 3 hours and helped cook their traditional dishes. They gave us tea and cake whilst we cooked, which was a lovely touch. We went back in the morning to help cook coconut roti’s for breakfast. They were also very helpful and arranged our safari trip to YALA and any other transport we needed during our stay. As for the room, it was a beauitful cabana with a lakeside view. The only downside is that the hotel is a little out of town from Tissa (about 4km). However, everything else about our stay was wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Lakeside Cabana (it was our favourite accommodation out of all the places we stayed whilst traveling around Sri Lanka) and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Tissa. Nothing negative to say about Lakeside Cabana. Just to note that the hotel is outside of town and not easily accessible by foot."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Lovely owners, excellent food, nice views. In addition we made Yala safari (all arranged my the hotel). Driver was very kind and we see a lot of animals Nothing"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"Nice place to stay, basic but comfortable. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,We reached the place at around 2am which was after the check in time.Unlike others this staff were really helpful. Breakfast was adequate and tasted petty well. We would highly recommend this place.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Location was great, and very close to Yala National Park. The experience of staying at this Cabana was great.Highly recommended for people planning to visit Yala National Park for safari. The staircase to the cabana should be flat. Because of the uneven surface, it was difficult to climb them or carry luggage upstairs. Wifi signal was extremely poor."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Free drinking water, free bike rentals.
We were right on the lake it was very peaceful. 
The hosts were really helpful and gave us clear directions to get to arugumbay.
The food was delicious (a little pricey compared to local restaurants though)
And the tour was fantastic we saw leapords, elephants, eagles and more. Tour ended up being a little more than we anticipated, but it was worth it.
The drinking water could have been in a larger container to reduce plastic waste."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"This is a family run business and the hosts really make sure you feel at home. They also run their own small safari operation so you can sort out your safari to Yala or other nearby parks directly with them. We stayed in the Family Cabana right by the lake, the cabana is simple but comfortable, and the location right by the lake offers a great view. Breakfast was good and abundant, and so were the meals which the hosts will prepare on request. Kids loved the cabana, the gardens, and the rabbits kept by the hosts, and obviously the safaris... we stayed 2 nights and did 2 safaris with Lakeside Cabana, to Yala and to Udawalawe, during which we could spot pretty much every (main) species there is to spot in these parks. As a plus, the owner, who is also a photographer, accompanied us in in the Yala safari and made some very nice leopard pictures (much better than mine) which she shared with us."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Excellent place for relaxation, we stayed only for one night and we regretted it as it was too short. Friendly people, great view, totally recommend it.  the cabana didn’t have windows. Maybe a mosquito net would have done the trick. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Nice modern and clean cabin in garden close to lakeHelpful family and staffOrganized safari"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Though we did not stay at lakeside cabana since the owners told us they had electricity issue. So, they arranged our stay at different resort named Cormorant lake resort. It was in front of the lake only. The hospitality of owners was awesome. Rooms were clean and under budget. Dinner was super tasty. Wish we had stayed in the resort we booked. Not sure issue of electricity was the genuine reason."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Everybody was super friendly, the rooms are amazing and the food delicious  The first mail: to book our tours with them or change the hotel"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"My husband and I stayed for two nights and it was an amazing experience. Our room was upgraded when we checked in to a room with a great view of the lake. The hotel was able to set us up with a full day safari tour the very next day. The food at the hotel was delicious. It’s traditional home cooked food. The curry was my favorite. The hotel is family owned and they were very nice. They made sure all their guest were taken care of. The rooms were nice and clean. They offer a mosquito net which kept all the bugs away. Overall, it was a very comfortable stay."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Really amazing jungle hut to stay in before our safari, which the owners organised for us the next morning. It was lakeside where you could see the local wildlife. We had a lovely evening meal. Was a really lovely experience feeling like you were staying in the middle of the jungle. We loved it even with the early start for the safari. The owner was lovely and couldn't be more helpful. Nothing"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Breakfast, lunch and dinner was very good food! Superb curry, fried rice and noodles.We had a super stay here. And the tour to see leopard was perfect: we could spot 2 leopards !!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,It was a very welcoming family and the rooms were very cosy and nice
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Such a great place to stay, lovely setting, large rooms, amazing dinner and really nice helpful staff
Also the welcome coconut"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"10/10 the view, the place, the nature Attention, the price might be tricky and need to book a safari with. Still a decent price and a great package. Breakfast on safari can improove a lot. Was the worst sandwish i had for years. Still 10/10 after this👌"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,Very relaxing athmosphere. A lot of places to chill out. Dinner was outstanding!  The young kid that was teasing us by turning on and off the light by eating. (Hihi joke)
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Fantastic place. Dinner was excellent and we had a packed breakfast on the safari.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"Such lovely and calm place, we loved staying here. A very lovely lady running the place. We had the traditional Sri Lankan dinner served by them which was very good! Just something they might have to concider is putting a bell when you need someone because upon arrival we couldn't seem to find anyone to check in. Something you also need to keep in mind is only cash payements.  "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"Family run business. Organized safari with Spotting Trails to Yala. Bindoo the leopard tracker is persistent and fun to talk to. Great cabins overlooking lake, delicious food and exceptionally friendly hosts. (Danushka and Vimukthi) N/A"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Perfect location
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"As you can see from the photos, it is beautiful. It also looks beautiful inside with a huge bed, mosquito nets and a big bathroom.
The staff was very friendly and helpful when we had issues with something.
We saw all animals you get to see in Yala, so the guide was good. I guess all guides are, because they call and talk with each other when they see the rare animals. So dont worry about that. Only cash payment. Also the safari needs to be paid in cash and you need to bring the money with you on the safari, nobody told us that."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"Realy nice Safari, we saw four Leopards and one bear. Also we saw many Elefants and the driver was so cool! 
"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,Nice and clean huts and a very nice garden. You can't swim in the lake. We saw a crocodile in it!
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"This was such a nice location! Its directly attached to the lake where hundreds of animals live and you can spend hours while watching them. We even saw more and different animals than in Yala-Nationalpark :DRoom was clean and there was enough space to put all your belongings. The staff was friendly and the food nice! We would definitely choose this accommodation again!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,Next to the lake
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Set right by the Debara lake in lush gardens, this hotel is a haven for people who love nature. The owners are a young couple, warm, enterprising and helpful. They provided us with a printout map of the local area so that we could walk independently. The area is beautiful and a bird watchers paradise. Our room was beautiful, large, on stilts, with a big veranda so we could sit out and enjoy the views, which are lovely. It had an efficient fan - very important as it’s hot in Tissa. The bathroom was great, with hot water. The room is partly open so didn’t have air con which some people might prefer to have. We were fine with a fan. It is a fair distance from Tissa, so you do need a tuc tuc to get to restaurants. Again, this isn’t really a problem as they are inexpensive."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,"The balcony with the lakeside view was stunning! We loved staying in a cabana! It was very clean and comfortable. The food was really good, and the staff were warm and helpful. Really good value for money! They also arrange tours of Yala National Park, which is convenient.  Whilst we loved the cabana style accommodation, we weren’t 100% comfortable with the bathroom window being completely open (compared the woodern slats in the bedroom). We paid 6500 rupees (£33) each for a safari to see leopards and bears - unfortunately it rained for the entire 7 hours. Only afterwards were we told by the guide that we were unlikely to see any leopards or bears in the rain - we wished we’d known this before. We had felt a little pressurised to go on the safari. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Incredible friendly hosts, always with a heartwarming smile, doing everything for you and you almost feel like part of the owner family. The women are cooking delicious, varying sri lankan food and rich continental or local breakfast. They offer safaris with their own jeeps, with wonderful picnic lunch and breakfast provided. 
Best location in Tissamaharama area directly at the lake, where a lot of wild life can be seen from the absolute lovely garden.
We even got bicycles for free to go around the lake!
All the best for this wonderful family!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,The location was great to relax by the lake with hammocks everywhere and seats. Dinner was AMAZING and a wonderful touch with the bonfire and torches everywhere. Just a really nice place!
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"From the minute we got there, we were made to feel welcome! We had travelled a long way to reach Tissamaharama and were really hungry so our hosts provided us with some tea and snacks. We later had dinner at the property and it was delicious! We booked our safari through them as well, and had the most amazing trip - we saw a leopard up close, a bull elephant, more elephants bathing, and crocs, lizards, birds etc. We stayed another night and had dinner again and the hosts could not do enough. The room was lovely and we even saw fireflies dancing around at night. The hosts dropped us to our bus the following day and were so kind if we needed anything. We have already recommended this place to several friends travelling Sri Lanka.  Nothing ☺️"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,Romantic cabins and great owners. We felt so welcome in lake side cabana’s! The safari - organized by them - was amazing. Big recommendation!
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Every thing was wow ! The location is amazing , the family running the place simply lovely , the food awesome , love in every details and the safari they organize is outstanding! The guide Bindu is a master and knows yala as his own pockets . Will bring you out of the regular track and will show you every animal existing ... we being blessed to see the leopard twice , for more than half hour just posing in front of us , literally 2 meters from our Jeep ! You guys rock !! Will be back ! "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Host is very kind, we arrived late at night and the prepared us full rice and vegetables supper..!Thanks!!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"This is the perfect place to spend some time near Yala National Park. We slept 2 nights, one in cabana and one in cottage. Both of them are very comfortable, in beautiful area.
The most important- very helpfull and kind people working here. Delicious food. Everything you need. 
I also want to recommend the best safari driver, Mr. Bindu. We saw a lot of wild animals, spent really exciting day! "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The owners are fantastic! They did more than they should have to meet our needs! The safari was great! They have an amazing driver who respects the animals and the driving rules!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Loved everything about this place. It was clean, the staff were amazing and knowledgeable, and the view was perfect! Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"We loved our cottage,bed was comfy and water was so hot!! Can’t express how happy we were with hot water haha. Staff were very friendly and the food was so good! Perfect and value for money would recommend. Dogs and animals are very loud during definitely need earplugs"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The property is just like the photos. Safari cabanas looking onto a wild life filled lake. 
Food was excellent the best Dahl in Sri Lanka. Amazing things to look at at the property and the gardens are amazing. Safari tour excellent and our jeep had the best morning tea. Driver knew about the fauna of Yala park and knew where to go. Highly worth the early morning start. Would return to stay longer and relax for a retreat. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We absolutely loved this place. Talk about getting in touch with nature. We had a view of the lake which was stunning in both the evening and morning and we were surrounded by wildlife, inside and outside the cabin. The host was really friendly and the food was excellent. Their Safari in Yala was also immense (we saw 5 leopards). Like I said, we loved the place and didn't want to leave, and really felt in touch with the local wildlife."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"This was our favourite place to stay during the last 3 weeks in Sri Lanka. 
A unique tree house overlooking the lake. Unfortunately we only had one night here, but I would recommend 2-3 nights at least.
My partner + I had one of the lakeside treehouse cabanas (the original one) which had the most amazing view across the lake.
We sat on our balcony enjoying the cool breeze + watching the  sunset over the lake. Water buffalo soaking themselves nearby.
My father had a ground level cabin which he really enjoyed (picture 2)
The bed is enormous with mosquito net over it. Bathroom water pressure is good and the cabin it very clean. Obviously no air-conditioning, but the breeze from the lake is cooling, plus x2 free standing fans are in the room if needed.
There are only a total of four cabana, as the owner wants to maintain a quite, intimate environment.
Evening meal was plentiful and delicious.
They also run their own safari tour to Yala, so we had a very early 4.30am departure. A complimentary packed breakfast was provided  which was varied + very filling. We were not required to checkout until after 1230 once we had returned from safari + showered, which was fantastic.
Yes, we saw a leopard at Yala!!
Driver/guide was excellent
I would absolutely recommend a stay here, you will not regret it. Wish we could have stayed longer.
This was the least expensive place we stayed, but I rate it as the best, personally I think they need to increase their prices.
 Nothing to dislike"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 7.9 ,The food is great and they can arrange affordable transport to and from their place! You are around 45min drive to the main park. So if you do a few safaris you spend. A bit of time going back and forth 
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The place was amazing by the lake. We wanted to have experience sleeping in a treehouse and all was great. Dashenka helped us to arrange Safari trip ( we saw elephants, alligators, birds, buffaloes etc) and her cooking was delicious. Warm water/shower in the treehouse and comfortable beds with mosquito nets. During the night we could hear birds singing."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.8 ,Safari trip and free bije ride day before to the great stupa
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Delicious food and well organized presentation. Friendly hotel staff and the location fulfilled my expectations. Nothing i can think of
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Awesome setting and cabin on the lake. The dinner was super and totally worth it. Their booked Safari was amazing, the guide provided really knew his stuff, and his quick action helped us spot a leopard! Later, we were first on site as the elephants migrated nearby. I’ve already recommended this place multiple times to other travelers. When I go back in the future, I’ll certainly stay there again! Nothing to complain about!Afternoon rains suck, but they evidently can’t control them, haha"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"One of the best places I stayed at during my one year trip!
Nice setting in a palm grove directly near the lake. Away from the busy main street but no problem since you can get good food there. Cabins were really spacious and well looked after. The owners were amazing! Very cute and caring. They can organize great safari tours. Definitely recommend booking through them!  Nothing!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"We came here for our 1 year anniversary and with the help of the owner she arranged to decorate our room with a cute 'happy annivarsary' note written in flowers on the bed. She did a great job in helping with the surprise for my partner. This place is absolutely incredible and is so serene and blissful. I could sit out on the hammocks and listen to all the wildlife for days on end. Rooms and bathroom were really clean and it was super lovely to have a nice warm shower especially on chilly evenings or after a muddy safari in Yala National Park. We ate all our meals at LakeSide Cabana and the portions were very generous and very tasty food!! We also booked a morning safari tour with LakeSide and our guide was so informative and helpful. We had a friend who was car sick and he was really patient and helpful towards making her feel more comfortable and better on the safari. We saw such a vast amount of wildlife and even spotted 2 leopards thanks to our guide!! Our experience in Yala was one we will never forget thanks to the wonderful staff at LakeSide Cabanas 🙏 We loved everything about this place. The owners, the accommodation and the service was nothing short of wonderful. The only downside which has nothing to do with the staff or accommodation itself.. But Google maps is terrible when directing us to the accommodation. Lead us on many unsealed roads but eventually got there after help from directions from the owner :) "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Great place in jungles at the lake. Very good owners. Homemade food is excellent. We arranged our Yala safari at the place and it was great. The driver was very experienced and knew how to find animals.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"The place is really nice , chill and peaceful. The room is big , the breakfast is nice. They put 10% more in the bill and in the booking information it was not mentioned. The internet didn't work well in the room."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Location was amazing for easy access to Yala and Udawalawe amongst others. Close to Tissa town, where there are many restaurants shops and the lake. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"This was great place to stay in the jungle near the lake. We stayed in the tree house with the view to the lake with wonderful sunrise and bird singing in the morning. Bed is very big, with the net from mosquitoes. Booked for two nights, but extended to 3. Very nice and friendly hosts. Before arrival it was a bit strange requirement to book safari only via them, but we have not regretted. First all day (12 hours) safari we booked to Lunugamwehera nat. park. All day we were only jeep in the park, but we saw a lot of birds, animals - driver was stopping for photography nearly every 5-10 min. I highly recommend this park instead of Yala. We were very disappointed choosing it as second - VERY, BERY big queues of jeeps everywhere in the park. In comparison to our first safari we saw only few birds, 3 elephants, buffalos, wild pigs and no promissed leopards.  Missing soap in bathroom. As we anyway always have with us, it was not a problem. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.0 ,Beautiful garden full of exotic plants and palm trees. Exeptional view on the lake. Delicious meals and very friendly staff. We booked Yala Safari with them and i can recommend it - profesional driver whose knowledge and experience will guarantee best memories. You can find All the creatures and bugs from the jungle in your cabana so better be prepared :)
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,"Nice cabana on the lake, rooms are a good size and bathrooms are nice for the price you pay. The family that run the place are friendly and helped us with our transport.  We booked a safari though them which they said was mandatory with the booking. We were forced to take a private safari even though we requested a shared one. I use the word ‘safari’ lightly as I am not sure how they can call this a safari. It is more like a group of Sri Lankan boy racers in converted pick up trucks wheel spinning around a dirt track in a national park. The one glimpse we got of an animal there were 40+ other ‘jeeps’ there within 30 seconds which made getting a view of the animal impossible let alone a decent picture. The drivers seem more interested in chatting with each other and smoking than they do looking after their customers. My advice is don’t waste your money with a safari in yala - you will regret it. Go somewhere else. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.6 ,"Loved being beside the lake looking out on the wildlife whilst swinging on a hammock and sipping a coconut that had just been knocked down. It was the life!
The family running it were so friendly and helpful, even went so far as to drop us into Tiss town centre. 
Dinner was fantastic and our most tasty meal of our trip! Gently spiced and so flavourful! 
We also booked Yala safari through the guesthouse and got to see a Leopard! 
All round great stay would really recommend  👍🏻 thank you 🙏 "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We had a wonderful stay in Tissa at the Lakeside Cabana. Great place, spacious rooms, very kind  hosts and great breakfast. 
The Yala safari tour was worth it - we booked via the hotel. 
We made a couple of more trips to less touristic places with our local friend Dim and his Tuk. Dim has been amazing!! The Tissa area has do much to offer - much more than just Yala. Was definitely worth our four night visit. 
We went to Kataragama, where Buddhist, Hindu and Moskim temples blend in. Also home to a big annual event. 
Another place is the jungle temple. A truly quiet, serene place surrounded by stunning nature. Local people only. 
We also visited a Hindu temple on a mountain top with a 360 degree stunning panoramic view.   You can get up there in a 1,5 our walk or in jeeps. 
Dim also took us to the beach - part where the shore and jungle meet. A long beach walk without seeing other people (apart for some local fishermen).  Amazing. 
Very close to that is the beach temple, a incredible subdown location. 
We love Tissa!
Thank you Lakeside Cabana and thank you Dim!
"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Fantastic cabins next to the lake. In the middle of the jungle. Really comfortable place to stay at for little money. We had dinner, which was really good. We took the safari from there, and we saw 3 leopards and an elephant. Please note, these are cabanas, meaning, the walls are half open. So, bugs can get in! everything was good!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"So peaceful by the lake. Hammocks in the garden, loads of birds around and for dinner we had fresh fish/ shellfish from the lake.  Also booked a safari through them ( Spotting Trails) which was good value and we saw plenty of animals in Yala. Bikes to borrow too if you want. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Really great place to stay. Wonderful food and cabanas just by the lake. The owner arranged our safari which also was great. Wonderfull that we got a taxi-ride with the owner to Merissa. So nice people. Hope to visit the place again.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.0 ,"Nice host. Beautyfull cabana to stay.We did a safari tour and it was great. We had the best driver you can get (we say 2 times People get stuck with there 4x4) and we saw the leopard twice. We were lucky but also because we had a good driver who know the path off the leopard.The bed was the best we slept on for whole our trip (1 month). We had some dinner there and it was perfect and not to spicy.  Thank you so much. I would stay there again. Nothing: unless it's close by the centrum but that's okay. You come for nature there ;)."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.0 ,The owner's smiles and the hospitality made our day. She is a very kind and friendly and helpful. The best cook ever. 
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Great location right on the lake. Also very good for organising a safari the next morning
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"For nature lovers it’s an absolute paradise. We had a fantastic safari to Bundala Bird Sanctury, where we saw a huge variety of birds, we also saw crocodiles, elephants, monkeys and jackal, all of which was organised by our lovely, friendly hosts who couldn’t do enough for us. Our cabana was comfortable and had a great balcony which overlooked a beautiful lake. The breakfast and dinner served to us on our two night stay was excellent, very tasty and plenty of it. I can highly recommend LakeSide Cabana to anyone visiting the area for wildlife. Thanks for a great stay guys Nothing at all"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"A great place to stay if going to Yala or Bundala. Pleasant surroundings and accommodation, good food and friendly and helpful hosts. Good value for money."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.0 ,We had the family Cabana with a view on the lake. This was really nice. An advantage was that in the evening you still had a nice breeze cooling you down at your terrace. Food is very good and the family who runs things are very friendly and helpful. We did the tour with them.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.0 ,"It's a lovely place, very calm and peaceful with friendly people. We did the full day safari and our driver Manju did his best to let us see the leopard and we did! Room is spacious and clean. Dinner is tasty! Dinner was very good and abundant the first night but second night was just noodles with 3 shrimps for 10usd (very tasty tho) oh and the breakfast for the safari should be improved it's just bread and more bread :( but lunch is great!!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.3 ,It has a very homely and very local vibes to it Loads of mosquito! It was a mosquito feast and we had a hard time sleeping!
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.0 ,"Safari, very kind people, good food, the driver of the Safari truck was very careful and didn't make a safari-race as most drivers there, VERY NICE"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,All. Very friendly staff :) Perfectly located near lake in the jungle but you need to be aware the Yale park is located 30-40 min drive.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Great Safari Feeling in the Jungle hut. Very clean and spacious. Very friendly hosts and great value for the money. The Safari was also very good organized with an excellent breakfast.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,View of the lake Nothing to dislike
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,It's wow..what a wonderful place..a owner is so friendly.the breakfast  is tasty ..I love this place.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"There is nothing ""not to like"" about the place, specially the family which owns and manages LakeSide Cabana Tissamaharama. Loved the location, the environment, food, and most importantly the people! Hope to return again (and again and...) By the way they arranged a Yala excursion for myself and my wife. While at Yala I managed the ultimate feat of loosing my phone. They went back just for that, and found the phone in the middle of the road!! Please do support them, as they do not run this as a business, but welcome their guests as family. That's what makes it a vacation."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.0 , Our cabana was next to the lake and it was relaxing. We enjoyed fishing at the lake eventhough we couldn't catch one 🤪 they have a perfect bbq place too.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Excellent place to stay with family or friends Foods is goods & Excellent service"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Location and the hospitality of the host. Environmental friendly accomadation at the edge of the lake with a beautiful view. Hot weather and mosquitoes.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Great stay, helping with everything. It was too short time to feel everything there. Hope to going back. Specially national park is closed, but they took us to different place to see animals, we saw lot of things and staff is excellent.  It is a little difficult time for everyone with this  corona cases, but we went there in a very special time. It is not a prolem from the hosts, but they was really helped us with all the time. It was superb. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.0 ,"The beautiful cabanas are located in a wonderful, relaxing garden area! Birds wake you up in the morning and we loved the nature feeling! Our hosts were fantastic, warm-hearted, and always with a smile. Unfortunately, we couldn't do the Yala-Tour because the Nationalparks closed on our arrival due to the Corona virus. However, they offered an alternative trip where we were able to spot some wild elephants which was an exceptional experience! Overall, I fully recommend this place and would definitively stay here again! During our stay the sink in the wash bowl wasn't working, so we couldn't properly use it. But it seems they fixed it directly when we left. Otherwise, we would have given 10 points."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,This place is amazing! Little wooden house is very cute and comfy. It is next to lake so you you want you can rest with a great view. Owners are very nice. Trip they organise to Yala is perfect! Driver is very knowledgeable and is nature fun. He showed us great places in National Park and he spotted a lot of animals. None
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 8.0 ,Located right on a lake with amazing views from the family cabana. Should note that it is open air but there is Alice needed mosquito net. We would have referred a Sri Lankan breakfast option.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Very friendly people, amazing food and amazing cabana! Definitely one of our favourite places to stay in Sri Lanka. We did a safari from there which was so enjoyable and the family went out of their way to talk to us and help us. The cabanas are a little out of the way but so nice to wake up to the view over the lake and very relaxing. Can't go past this place for value!!
 Nothing. Eveything great"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Everything is perfect!!! I loved the view 😍 and a very peaceful place.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Such a beautiful environment arround the cabanas. Helpful family staff.easy to book atranspotation to the places arround them and they did not charged for that. Free  papaya and banana offered by their father, from his own farm. I don't know."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Beautiful place to stay Nothing
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,I like their lovely family staff. They took us arround the village to the river and to the lake. And also to their jungle farm. We went to the yala national park with their land rover and its also perfect tour. I like the place and the people their. I reccomoned this place.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Really peaceful garden and lake view.lot of vegetables they are growing. And also they had fruit farm. They offered those for us free of charge. Their lovly cottages are very Romantic. And comfortable. I love this place and want to go back. Nthng to dislike.

Staff were brilliant,  room was fantastic, food was delicious,  grounds were first class and the artisan village was wonderful. Really didn't want our stay here to end. Hope to return one day 🤞😍😍 Was such a shame we couldn't buy a spa robe, we had lots of amazing treatments during our stay, would have been so nice to have a robe to snuggle into at nights to remind us of our wonderful honeymoon 💖💖💖"

Many different places to sit and rest .   Main restaurant is not cozy and pleasant. Price of food is disproportionate. "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was perfect. Worth each euro spent. Room really spacious, hight standard even for the smallest details. The entertainment areas, activities and the pools were amazing- perfect place to go with kids,teenagers or in couple!.Each morning we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast, big choice for each food style. We will definitely recommend the Shangri-La resort Hambantota without any doubt. Thank you Ghislene for you kind and warm welcoming. "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything  They were ubusing the fact that they are the only decent place offering lunch or dinner in the area so prices are v expensive

shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.3 ,"Amazing facilities. Fantastic sunsets on the beach. Food is pretty good (breakfast especially) and the 3 pools are excellent. Great effort made to cater for kids. A really impressive site. Service was always friendly but sometimes lacked efficiency - seemed they liked to stick to rigid, at times nonsensical, rules. All slightly too formal for our liking. You also feel a little isolated - location is quite remote and a real trek from the airport: about 4-5 hours by taxi. "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Attention to details Slow service
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,"The pool, the rooms, the comfortable bed, the breakfast and the friendly staff. Beautiful resort all together.  The gym is small"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Huge hotel with AMAZING staff! We were checked in by Chami who was very friendly and helpful. She entertained our request to view the rooms (we wanted a connecting room) before deciding on which rooms . We ended up with 2 connecting rooms near the reception area which was pretty amazing!! It's spacious, clean and very comfortable.The spa at the hotel was out of this world! My husband and I had a 90-min massage and it was one of the best massages we've tried so far!Throughout our 3 nights stay, we played beach volleyball, beach football and aqua gym which was amazing! Love the teens play area! Lack of restaurants."

shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 7.9 ,High quality resort with a decent golf course It’s a long drive from Colombo.  
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,We had the resort to ourselves as there was a big conference on and they were inside all the time. Was amazing for families.  Found the Buffett a bit awkward with stations in the foyer. That’s the only bad thing I have to say. Oh and be mindful of spending to much in the village. We found most things sold there cheaper elsewhere. 
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.3 ,"Clean room with great terrace. Beautiful pools looking out onto the beach. Beautiful setting. Good range of food at dinner including chicken/beef/fish which we hadn't had much of before. Incredible hot fresh naan breads made in front of us on request in tandoor stone oven. Was quite empty which felt a bit eerie in such a large resort. Some restaurants and bars were closed, we think as the hotel wasn't full but this was annoying. Staff were slightly too attentive and asking for feedback continually, however they were doing a great job!"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,The hotel is exceptional. The golf course is just perfect! the quality of the food is very high. the customer service is one of the best I have ever seen!

shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Excellent resort, with great staff and good restaurants. The rooms are very big and comfortable. The beach is always empty  and looks amazing. Very nice pools, one for the whole family and a quite, adult only one. It is not the place to go for swimming. the sea is very rough but you can compensate by using the pools."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,Everything.. The long Beach has a stunning view. Staff are very helpful so that i wanted to thank in particular Hemashi from reception for making our stay comfy. Food is great.  I didn't like that there is nothing to do outside the resort. No shops or street foods or anything near in that area
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,So many activities for children - my 2 year old daughter was entertained for the whole duration of the stay. She didn’t want to leave!! Nothing
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 7.9 ,"We loved the slides and the kids pool. The lovely friendly staff and everyone in the kids club and trapeze.. they made the holiday extra special for us and the kids We had workers building the road outside directly outside our room and though they did not disturb us this interfered with our relaxing garden view.The sliding door to the garden was splattered with dead mosquitoes.The outside furniture upholstery could have been cleanerThe village has a bridge - which is uneven and my daughter fell there. We later found out that quite a few people fall there. I think for safety reasons something needs to be done about this."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"It was a Shangri-La....just enough to say.And a big reccomendation to receptionist Jullianne from Colombia,  and our housekeeper Pushpalam (sorry if I did not write it properly) Everything was just perfect."

shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,"Food is great, large comfortable rooms, great facilities for kids Rough beach, not possible to take a swim in the ocean, also not really inviting for walks if you're with kids, so the beachfront side of the property is not that inviting"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Beautiful place with lot of activities. Very little choice for vegetarian. Being an international chain I expected more choice . The Indian food was not up to mark. Last day the Dosa was good . It did get better from our first meal.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Cleanness , hospitality for children , beach , garden and an amazing view !!! Needs more lounges and the food was mediocre."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Food has improved enormously since our last visit.  The hotel is very comfortable and our room boy was excellent and so was the boy who served us lunch at the bar who went out of his way to get us what we wanted. Beautiful grounds but it was too hot to really make the most of it.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,This is the most amazing hotel. The grounds and pool are just incredible. Buffet breakfast is unbelievable. The room was huge and extremely luxurious.

Fab 7am yoga session with Sajith, only me so one to one, very supportive, helped me deeper into positions
Beautiful spa, I had the chi journey which included the best back & scalp massage I've ever had, so relaxing, lovely, thanks to Pema.
Husband had two rounds of golf (no-one else on course), great course, greens in fantastic condition, hired clubs are good, excellent caddies.  Thankyou.

shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.3 ,"views were amazing, room was comfortable and quiet, driver was nice to the airport on our last day (Easter Sunday) and the reception staff at the hotel constantly phoned to keep us updated on the situation in Colombo and to make sure we were safe staff were really hit or miss, some were very helpful and kind while others were just not. food was pretty mediocre at best, definitely expect more from a hotel where their audience for food is captive, not worth the price at all in that regards"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"We had the most perfect stay here. The staff are impeccable, they were extremely accommodating to our needs.  The golf course is great. The adult only pool is peaceful and perfect for relaxing. The food from all restaurants and pool side were superb, very tasty! The evening entertainments was excellent!"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.2 ,Amazing welcome drink and greeting from the staff! The room was clean and the hotel gave us a little birthday cake for my boyfriend! Facilities were amazing and we were thoroughly looked after by the staff!
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 7.5 ,The variety of pools that meets everyone’s expectation. Lack of information about the facility by the staff.  The in-room service is not up to the international standard.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,A stunning hotel with excellent facilities - the adults only pool was particularly welcome! Food was fantastic and staff could not do enough for you. They were also great with providing a cake for my wife on her birthday and they upgraded us as it was our honeymoon. We had a great time here. There was some sort of big HSBC event on for the entirety of our stay which meant that there was a lot of noise and commotion in certain areas of the grounds. This was never communicated to the other guests which was a shame. The other very frustrating thing was the fire alarm that would go off at regular points throughout the night. This happened about 3/4 times every night of our 3 night stay. THIS MUST GET FIXED!
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,Everything was awesome except for the fungus in the pool.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Very nice hotel with good view and friendly staff:)
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.3 ,Resort Rough sea
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"This resort has been built only 3 years ago so everything looks top notch and as good as new.
I drove 5 hours from Colombo Airport to Hambantota merely for the sake of staying in this breathtaking resort. It’s 100 archers in total, It’s so big you can easily get lost in it and the best part is that it’s all nature and green, sea and palm trees. The environment is so friendly and give you nothing but positive vibes. I promise you this is a resort you won’t regret. Wish I had stayed for more than one night "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.6 ,We stayed there two nights. The facilities and amenities in the resort are excellent. It has many activities to do in the meantime as well. The golf course is great as well. Food was good overall. Staff was very friendly and helpful. One of the best resorts in Sri Lanka.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.0 ,By far the best thing about this resort were the staff. They were super helpful and polite in all areas. The only area for improvement was the food. While many options the quality of the western and Chinese food was not the usual food I experienced in other shangri la hotels.  The chefs were very helpful and eager to please however. Fruit was excellent.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,everything was good
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,"Plenty of activities for kids including a dedicated arts and play centre with dedicated staff to look after kids above 4 years, Trapeze, couple of slides with a massive kids pool, buffet just for kids and a kids dining area, dedicated main service to look after kids
Golf lessons were great on a 18 hole course
Spa has 90min sessions at reasonable prices
 Food was awesome but the customer service at the restaurant needs to improve. We requested a high chair and we had a follow up couple of times to get the chair"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Location, facilities and  the staff of the hotel which were very helpful  Everything was perfect "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 7.9 ,The staff was friendly and helpful Too crowded and noisy
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Definitely worth every cent. We were blown away by the hospitality and the efficiency of the staff. We were greeted by name everywhere we went. The hotel itself is breathtaking with so much to do for the entire family.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. We travelled out of season and as a result not all the restaurants at the hotel were open and not all the organized events took place. Understandably so since the hotel was only at 25% capacity on 2 of the nights we were there.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The activities, pool and food were amazing. We enjoyed the traditional dancing. Staff were very approachable, friendly and welcoming. We like almost everything in the hotel. Highly recommended!  Slight delay while checking and we were waiting around  20 minutes. However, apologies were extended and also, the delay didn't affect our stay at all. "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything Nothing
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Everything fantastic

And the breakfast made us feel like we are in heaven.Everything was fresh and delicious everything was perfect
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.0 ,"No surprise with Shangri-La. This is real 5 stars, international standard. Very clean, large room, nicely decorated. Good food . Nice swimming pool.Not crowded, and no feeling of being in a giant industry hotel. Too bad, impossible to go for a swim in the Ocean (the view is beautiful though).Too far also from the 1st accessible beach for a swim or a dive (in Tangalle, 1h drive minimum)."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"The hospitality was outstanding and i love the friendly nature,it doesnt feel that you out of your home because it was like a next home for me.."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was excellent the staff was very friendly and helpful the gentleman who is in the reception (Jeevan) was very helpful for us with all the information of the hotel and also he gave us a website to look for the daily activities.
We enjoyed a lot, and will definitely recommend this place.  Beach was very rough which is to a hotel’s fault I believe."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Amazing hotel with top class facilities and services!Very good food and incredible breakfast.Perfect swimming pools (one for adults only) and nice natural beach.All the staff is extremely kind and nice and rooms very modern.Plenty of daily activities for whole family, golf and great gym.Special thanks to all the restaurant/bar staff, lifeguards and Sajith for really good yoga classes!"
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 9.0 ,"Lovely resort, absolutely huge and so much to do. 
Lovely staff, a lot of the staff went above and beyond. 
Very comfortable room! We loved our stay here. Great for families!  Loved almost everything. Wasnt a fan of the pan asian restaurant. Food was substandard especially for this resort! 
Beach isn't great! 
Also service at the front desk is very slow, had to wait a while, they need more staff to serve! "
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 7.5 ,"This Shangri-La is setup to provide you with most of what you might need for a vacation without having to set foot outside or explore SriLanka’s authentic beauty (if that’s your intent). It has wonderful facilities including 3 pools, a water pad, several dining options, walking space, a trapeze, kids club, room game, golf area, beach (no swimming but beautiful to play around the waves).... and you can arrange for pretty much any outdoor activity (surfing, historic, spiritual, safaris, biodiversity, spices and teas, ....). The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming. Be ready for seclusion and for paying a big price tag to everything. 
This property is far out from everything and the setup is such that you pay a minimum of 80USD for any trip out. Getting from Colombo airport is a solid 4 to 5 hours (again at a price tag).
This did not stop us from exploring 4 days out of 7 and returning to a lovely location that’s so peaceful and quiet.
I know we can explore amazing SriLanka with a different and cheaper experience so it truly depends on what you are looking for as a priority."
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Every single thing. Totally amazing experience.
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.8 ,"Nice Pool, very polite staff, a lot of things to do (pool table, ping pong, etc), the rooms are nice The food is ok, but not european 5 star hotel like - they should offer more local choices in the restaurants!"

shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,Best place to relax. 
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 8.0 ,Given the circumstances the staff were accomodating and the few tourists left were still treated really well.  Due to circumstances activities and the beach were closed but relaxing by the pool was still a great way to pass the day. 
shangri-la-39-s-hambantota-resort-amp-spa, 10 ,"Everything was absolutely perfect, from rooms, the cleanliness, the view ( garden view), the the three pools, kids club. Special mention for Mr. Padma the chef, from India  who offered us additional items in breakfast. Liked every bit of it"

taj-samudra, 8.8 ,Very friendly staff
taj-samudra, 10 ,The staff / service. Food Nothing
taj-samudra, 10 ,"A long standing establishment with over three decades of experience without dropping the quality of service, evolving with technology, but not losing the personal touch that can only be achieved by professional personnel with experience and a caring mindset.  The fast pace of developments around the venue has dented the old serene views through the room windows. "
taj-samudra, 8.3 ,"Gym and squash courts were a massive bonus. Tennis courts available too, great hotel to stay in for anyone who loves sports! Good location in the heart of colombo and near the beach. Rooms are a bit outdated and could do with some renovation. "
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Location,Sea view Staffs are kind especially front office Mr.Dushan Nothing "
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,"Hospitality and food quality was un matchable.Room service was also very prompt. Lay out of Breakfast was very messy.I think its due to lack of space."

taj-samudra, 10 ,"Great rooms. Superb service. Especially Yasitha at the front desk and Sunil - a man Friday who helps with anything! 
We had a pretty ordinary experience  at another 5-star hotel in Colombo and walked into Taj not expecting anything better. However they were super. Keep it up!!!"
taj-samudra, 8.3 ,"Great check in, friendly staff, one of our rooms was badly smelling of smoke but the staff changed room immediately, also helped with arranging car and some things we forgot in the room after we left. Restaurant service was slow. Property looks a bit run down and need some refresh/maintenance, especially the area behind the hotel (tennis court and pool)."
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,Upgrade and room Chaos in restaurant and staff taking time to fix issues
taj-samudra, 10 ,Everything was just perfect... The staff was also very courteous..specially Mr Sunil house keeping manager at 4th floor A private beach would have been a bonus

taj-samudra, 9.2 ,The staff was incredibly gracious and took very good care of our 9 year old. From the location it wasn't really possible to walk to other locations.
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,"Obviously the location is killer. Smack in the middle of the Galle face. The house keeping staff was fantastic. Keeping up our well used-to tradition of in-room dining, we found the Sri Lankan-Chinese Dishes quite good. Superb Galle-Face/Ocean views from room 509. Breakfast primarily catered for the large seemingly uninterrupted flow of Indian guests. We were quite happy with the Sri lankan porridge however( Kola Kanda ). Some of the Taj rooms are dated. We we offered a room in the newer wing but opted for room 509 for the balony. It certainly could do with some improvements, starting with the water damaged floor adjoining the bathroom."
taj-samudra, 10 ,room size lift
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Superb staff especially at check in. The hotel has a wide variety of restaurants and is very well located in the city. Rooms are newly renovated and comfortable. noise isolation between rooms and walkways is not good. You can easily hear a conversation in the room across or anyone walking on the floor.
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"Good location, Opposite the breach. Architecture of the hotel is very nice. Grand entrance. One of the oldest five star properties in Colombo "
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Superb room.Excellent breakfast.Great service Waiting for breakfast!"

taj-samudra, 10 ,"Food was really good , And the spread was superb . The property is well maintained and very clean ."
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,"The service at the front desk, in room dining, concierge. Poor service in the port of calls restaurant. Think there needs to be more responsibility in terms of taking food requests. In our 4 day stay we noticed, on multiple occasions, the waiters either got the food request wrong or just disappeared on us. Making us wait thinking the food would arrive but it was never passed on the chef or the kitchen. We will definitely look at the next visit only post confirmation that this has been addressed. Food and restaurant service is something Taj is known for; let's not make an negative exception."
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,"Good service and good food, nice location and great facilities with big pool and great fitness center."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Spacious rooms, neat and clean property!!

taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"The breakfast and dinner were good In most of the dishes, chutneys and other curries the salt content was on the upper side"
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,Great breakfast with wide selection. Friendly staff always willing to serve. Good ambiance in the lobby and good location. Good Chinese Restaurant - Golden Dragon Rooms were a bit dated. Some of the bedding and carpets had dirt marks. This is our reason for low rating on cleanliness. These were reported to the management who took the matter seriously and worked to provide some recompense. Did not compare well with our stays at Taj Hotels in India particularly complimentary services in room were lacking.e.g. fruit.
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Amazing staff, facilities, restaurant. We were upgraded to the suite, sent fruit and wine and chocolates to the room. Free entry to the lounge and loads more. Everything was perfect from check in to leaving."

taj-samudra, 7.5 ,Great location
taj-samudra, 10 ,The staff - the staff - the staff. They are very attentive and universally friendly. We were there for our anniversary and they treated us incredibly - would like to thank Jayamini and her colleagues Sakuni Naveesha and Andrea of the front office for really spoiling us - they have unfortunately set the benchmark so high I may  have problems in the future !-unless of course I make the decision to book into the Taj - if I don't I'm in trouble. It is a shame that the huge gardens are not utilised - only the pool area which is very nice is layed out for guest use but access to other areas not restricted.

We thought the Club lounge would be a nice bonus but found out the kids weren’t allowed in.  There is no nightclub as advertised or no kids club.  Which is why we booked it.  The beach is not allowed to be used.This said, the hotel, restaurant, bar and staff made up for it.  Jo"
taj-samudra, 8.3 ,"Club lounge staff and facilities were excellent. Service at the main restaurant, Ports of Call was a bit patchy."

My room was quiet and the hotel staff were all friendly and helpful.Excellent food at the Japanesse restaurant Yu Mi and good selection at breakfast. Only thing I missed was not having a Sauna and spa pool. Although the changing room and spa room was very spacious and I did enjoy it. I think with a little redesigning it could be amazing."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"The hotel is at a great location overlooking ocean and it added beauty with monsoon showers. We stayed for 8 nights and felt at home as Chef Dayalan prepared sumptuous food customised to individual taste and the attendants, in particular Malar, Ashen, Chamila, Morin, Tharuka took good care with liberal serving of food at Port of Call. Duncan and Buddhika at the reception ensured our stay was comfortable... The rooms could have been more spacious for a family of three.."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Breakfast spread was nice. We were given a complimentary upgrade to the Suite as we were travelling with family and needed adjacent rooms. The staff was nice and friendly, always willing to help. The water bottles were of glass which makes a LOT of difference to the amount of single-use plastic not generated by the hotel. Unfortunately we travelled on full moon days to the city. Though we had club rooms, we could not fully utilise the Club Lounge facilities. Also, due to the recent developments in the city there was tightened security. But of course these are things the property cannot be blamed for. This is being done for the security of guests staying with the hotel.Water Pressure in the showers was quite low."
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,All Nothing 
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,Close to everything. Very friendly friendly staff. I mean very friendly. Rooms are large. Very clean.  Food needs alot of work. No quality in the food or ingredients. Indian restaurant was great in side the arcade. Japanese was just terrible. Room service was just as bad. No beach access closest beach is about 2 hours away by car. 
taj-samudra, 10 ,Wonderful place to stay and relax. Great location. Superior hotel rooms...warm reception and great service by the staff.
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,"The pool area is exceptional, they have a good sitting area and the pool itself is very nice. The restaurants are very tastefully done, the staff is friendly and very cooperative and the hotel is located in probably the best area in Colombo. I think the rooms are a little small in the new wing, could’ve been bigger. Apart from that I can’t really think of anything that I would change."
taj-samudra, 10 ,Staff is friendly and helpful. Everything is good
taj-samudra, 10 ,Hotel location room ambience great Indian food  Nothing 
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Everything about the hotel was amazing. These guys are upholding the Taj brand. The staff were excellent, the room was beautiful, breakfast was amazing with an excellent spread. I feel everyone who visits Colombo should stay here. You will not regret it.  Nothing not to like. Amazing experience. I’m going back again."
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,City View Room
taj-samudra, 10 ,Breakfast was super Nothing special
taj-samudra, 10 ,Everything!
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Excellent Hotel with great location in front of the Sea with great views, good food and excellent staff nothing"
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,Loved the comfortable bed and the large walk in shower
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Lovely hotel.  Gorgeous pool.   Helpful staff.  Clean room. Slightly disappointing variety of buffet at breakfast, for instance a muesli or healthy cereal of some kind would be nice."
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,Location of the property is excellent.
taj-samudra, 10 ,"The views were amazing and the staff were so generous that they upgraded me and my friend to a executive suite, so our room was huge!! 
All together an amazing experience "
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"Staff was good & tried to accommodate as much as they could. Buffet breakfast was quite a huge spread with polite staff No Bath tubAmenities like tiny shower gel bottles were not replenished unless requested Pool was rather old & decrepitFood- esp room service was INEDIBLE"
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Location Rooms are small
taj-samudra, 10 ,The Legendary Taj Hospitality. The staff came to see me out on my leaving the hotel.  It was unprecedented. Staff should clean the cups in the room everyday. They were not doing this.  It was unclean.
taj-samudra, 10 ,Great location well maintained 
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,Great service standards in the coffee shop
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Check-in was quick, I was given a upgrade because of me being a member. The hotel has 5 restaurants which makes itself quite a touristy place. 2 of them are one of top rated on trip advisor. The view from the room was quite something to stare at. The location is perfect and familiar with Tuk Tuks as Taj has been there for almost like 30 years. Even the Indian and US embassy is just a 5 minute walk away. The hotel uses specially packaged glass water bottle instead of plastic ones which in my opinion adds to the 5 star experience. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of water pressure in my room. But it could be just a problem with my room."
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,"It was a wonderful stay at the Taj Samudra. There arent that many places to eat nearby, so one has to rely on the hotel for food. But had a good time."
taj-samudra, 10 ,Taj Samudra is a lovely place to spend your holidays great location excellent amenities and a very nice staff  Nothing 
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,"Very good property clean rooms fantastic F&B outlets & very very friendly staff.Ms.Fortune Jansz, Mr Sheehan & Mr Avishek Mukherjee looked after me very well when I was sick and Mr Hanif helped me procure medicine late night within a short time.Our gratitude to Ms Dinusha Rangwala.Thanks to Shashika Amarasinghe & team for their services"
taj-samudra, 10 ,Wonderful place Nothing to dislike 
taj-samudra, 10 ,Everything NA
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,THE ROOM SIZE  WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER  SEEN   AND MOST COMFORATBLE AND  WELL ORGANISED    EXCELLENT FURNITURE AND  ARRANGEMENTS THE COLD CHECK IN EXPERIENCE
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Everything. Except what I am penning below. We had booked a twin room but were given a double room instead and then a roll away bed was placed which was something we did not expect and it was not good. Apart the taxis at the hotel concierge cost almost double or more (4 times for hotel own car) to commute which is a bit unreasonable.
taj-samudra, 10 ,"great breakfast buffet and yummy omelette made from scratchfabulous poolstunning viewfriendly staff"
taj-samudra, 8.3 ,I particularly liked the personalised service at the executive lounge. We had a few business meetings at the executive lounge and Rahman did an excellent job of serving us and making sure we were comfortable at all times. Some of the staff could improve in their spoken English.
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"breakfast as pretty good but it was exceedingly busy at times.  Coffee and tea were only OK - you really need fresh milk but I know its expensive we had a balcony room overlooking the sea - lovely but huge downside because it was stormy and windy and the wind whistled through the balcony doors and made a horrendous noise most nights.Also the air conditioning was difficult to control - it was either too cold or not cold enoughThe bathroom was too small and there was a puddle of water around the base of the toilet every day"
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,The manager on duty was very helpful as we  forgot our money in bentota and he was very helpful to get it back from there to Colombo and I am very greatful to him as well as manager in taj bentota as I got my money back and staff was very courteous and helpful 
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,"The location The behaviour of the staff at check in counter, I had requested twice thru booking.com plus sent an email to hotel for early check in plus had sent email enquiry regarding airport pick up but no reply was received from hotel, I did receive email reply from booking.com though."
taj-samudra, 10 ,The view! 
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"All staffs are well trained, kind, and all the way professionals. View from the windows are excellent if your room is located in sea side. Dinner and breakfast are both offered in buffet style and their various menus kept me from being bored. However the hotel has no responsibility, you must be careful there are so much ""mock"" guides hanging out around the hotel."
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,"Everyone from reception to room service were always ready to serve with smile. Asanga from room service , I guess , was very helpful. Nice property- Nice people is great combo for nicest vacation !!  All’s well .."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Where Do I begin ...I am truly at loss for words to describe the most beautiful experience we had at the Taj Samudra @ Colombo. It was our first time in Colombo, while we have heard such great things about the place, the reason we chose was only because of the proximity of the destination to Chennai and my husband & I  were looking to celebrate our sons birthday in some nice place away from home . Also we chose Taj again because of the credibility the brand has wrt being guaranteed of some great properties & hospitality. But truly we never expected the kind of experience we got.... The Taj Samudra property is in a great  location with beautiful decor but what truly did make the place absolutely special were the staff.  True to its word, the hospitality and courteousness of the staff was more than what we ever expected. It was our son's birthdays and we happen to mention to the staff when we were checking in. We were amazed at the length they went to have special surprises organized on both their birthdays.
Some of the staff who I really want to take a moment to thank - Niranjali the Guest Relations Executive is a true jewel giving guest relations a new high standard ... Naveesha & Dinusha were so kind and took care of us while we were there  along with Niranjali. Special thanks to them for making our stay unforgettable. Haneef Gafoor the Concierge was another stellar staff, always with a smile on his face and so helpful. He ensured he gave suggestions keeping in mind whats best for us & not what he has in hand to offer... Some of the other staff members who really stood out and went out of the way to make it special are - Kasun ( Golden Dragon Restaurant), Sunil / Samuel ( apologies If I got the name wrong) the Supervisor & Damith & Gayan the house keeping staff."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"I want to do a special shout out to Chrish and Haneef, the 2 concierges I interacted with during my stay. They were extremely helpful with tours, coordinating some of our activities around the city and to Kandy; they went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. Thank you so much guys! I much appreciated all your support, and friendliness. Keep up the great work!"
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Over seeing the ocean, very well located."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Great food - excellent service.Staff very attentive. Can't think of anything that needs improving.Well done."
taj-samudra, 7.9 ,Service. Breakfast was good. Location is excellent. The property is a bit old.
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,"safe and Quiet hotel very a friendly staff & good location and elegant hotel in colombo ."
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,"Excellent all round service from reception , concierge , breakfast and rooms.  Were upgraded to Executive 4th floor . Amazing room size and decor. Good breakfast selection.  On booking.com  it mentions typical rooms can accommodate 3 pax , but can only accommodate 2 pax.                                          
In standard rooms no space for extra Bed or even sofa bed..only Executive rooms can accommodate 3 pax.                                            "
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"Ideal location with easy access to transportation . Room was big enough & did not feel cramped up . All the staff from the helper to the managers were very kind & ready to help ."
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,Clean Small room
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Beautiful hotel. Staff are so lovely and helpful! The buffet breakfast is delicious. Also tried out one of the restaurants for dinner - Indian, also delicious. The rooms are lovely and spacious. The bed was so comfortable, have not slept that well in a long time. Really enjoyed my stay, only regret is wish I could have stayed longer. "
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Excellent location, service and hospitality!"
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,There was an Octoberfest happening when we stayed there.  It was very noisy until midnight and we didnt know about it until we checked in
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,"Clean, comfortable, great amenities and very friendly and helpful staff. The gym was well equipped and had thoughtful touches such as complementary sugar and salt drinks. The club rooms are worth paying for, and provide access to the Club Lounge with superb views of the Indian Ocean and very attentive staff. A big shout out to the housekeeping staff who provided some light moments and clearly enjoy what they do.  The hotel itself is a little isolated in terms of outside bars, restaurants and activities, but getting to those locations is easy enough with taxis that are plentiful and cheap. "
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Buzzy
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,Central location facing the beach.  No real spa or massage services at the hotel
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,"Gorgeous property, very well located. Large, yet staff are very warm and personal.  The rooms, though comfortable, need sprucing up as they are slightly behind the times - and need to keep pace with the modern hotels that have or are coming up in Colombo. "
taj-samudra, 10 ,Excellent hotel with amazing view and great staff 👍Will surely be back soon

taj-samudra, 10 ,We loved everything - especially the gym Our neighbours in the room next door played very loud music. Some of the rooms had a shower curtain and not a door.
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,"Location view and service was amazing Breakfast was a bit too crowded, and all the food wasn’t always upto the mark."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Breakfast was very good. We had lounge facilities, and the service was very good. Very nice pool and fitness room. "
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,Superb. A lot of varieties in breakfast and enjoyed the same with family.
taj-samudra, 8.3 ,"- Great property, at the beach, high quality stuff. 
- Very good staff, good room service
- Great spread of restaurants - too spicy though :) 
- Got am early check in  - Nothing really, loved it!"
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Beautiful hotel, great facilities! 
Excellent staff! "
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,"Loved the whole estate ... rooms a bit old in style but it is really clean and homey  Other hotel guests at the pool were spitting close to the pool ,, I guess in some cultures that is fine ... but I thought it gross gross and disgusting "
taj-samudra, 10 ,Everything!!!! Nothing we didn't like
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"The breakfast had a large selection. Hotel is located in a very central area. Everything is within 10-15 mins driving distance from there. Hotel was helpful and gave us a wheelchair for the duration of our stay. Golden Dragon had the most amazing food! Loved that they use glass bottles that are recyclable and not using plastic! The room could have been a bit cleaner, am referring to the wooden cabinets. Also the fridge kept leaking so there was a puddle of water in the room."
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"1. Amazing location2. Absolutely fantastic hospitality. Excellent and most charming service3. Large hotel with massive grounds4. Excellent, fully equipped and large gym5. Big pool, and lovely spa 6. Excellent food (ate at the Japanese restaurant and room service)7. Musician in the lobby in the evening was fantastic. 8. Ocean view from the balcony is mind-blowing9. Water is served in glass bottles and not in plastic ones. Great initiative Some rooms are new and the others are old. The latter are comfortable but have a tired feel about them. The hotel is about 30-40 years old and i guess that is to be expected."
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,"Location , the swimming pool, staff was also good. I had asked for the extra bed to be ready ,as i was arriving early morning at 3am . The same wasn't done and also had shift my room as it wasn't what I had asked for . The buffet had very few veg options "
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,breakfast was good and was having plenty of choice.
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,Fantastic service and superb breakfast. I love staying with Taj The shower temperature was unstable and would oscillate from boiling hot to cold in minutes
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,Service Windows
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,Break fast. The front desk upgraded our room which was amazing on their part. Very attentive staff
taj-samudra, 10 ,The Ambience was amazing. The Taj Club Room Staff
taj-samudra, 10 ,"The gym, pool area and breakfast were phenomenal. The rooms were clean and spacious. One of rooms had a material shower curtain (the other room was glass and was much better)."
taj-samudra, 8.8 ,"Lovely location, rooms and hospitality. Would visit again  Breakfast could have been better "
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,"We did not know that the hotel was located on the most popular and crowded area and road of the city, Gale Face. Our room had very nice view of the sea shore line and the popular spot of the city. Breakfast and dinner was very good with so many local and international dishes, very rich buffet. The swimming pool and GYM was relaxing, not crowded. Staff was very friendly and helpful. As a consequence of very sad events of 2019, security, including the hotel's, was intense and sometimes annoying, although we can understand the reflex. Actually all the people we encountered were very peaceful and mostly friendly. Hotel room was small and needs some upgrades. Bathroom was also small."
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"Excellent breakfast, but a tad repetitive. Offhand can't think of anything"
taj-samudra, 10 ,"WE LOVED THE HOSPITALITY, THE STAFF WAS AMAZING. WE WERE CELEBRATING OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY AND THEY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE IT EVEN  MORE SPECIAL FOR US. THERE WAS CAKE , CHOCOLATES , FRUITS AND AN UPGRADE.  MISS SHARMILA WAS VERY WARM IN RECEIVING US AND ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR US THROUGH OUT OUR STAY. RECOMMENDED."
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"The staff was warm and hospitable; they extended us the latest possible check-out. The food on the premises ranged from great to AMAZING (the Indian restaurant is absolutely top-notch, as was breakfast). We loved our room; it was comfortable and clean and had all the amenities we could ever dream of Sri Lanka. Highly Recommend. When we arrived, the room we were originally given smelled of cigarette smoke (STRONG); the hotel representative was quick to find us a new room, however -- the new room was smaller than the original. This is was disappointing."
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,The location was great as was the pool. Lots of security which was comforting. The pool was also open until late which was helpful. Food was great! We upgraded our room - the process of which was easy and the staff were helpful at all times. Standard room was below par but we upgraded at extra cost so it was okay.
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,The attitude of the staff
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,The club rooms are very nice we downgraded because we wanted a balcony and the club rooms don’t have balconies rooms are okay no bath bit outdatedBalcony are quite dirty Pool area was niceYou can not smoke around the pool area But you can have a smoking room
taj-samudra, 9.2 ,Location 
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Absolutely everything else. Excellent food and service otherwise. Great room and bathroom. What a sea view. Queue during breakfast is absolutely chaotic and unruly on the weekend, and I had to ask 4 times for a complimentary bottle of wine which was ridiculous."
taj-samudra, 10 ,"We liked everything about the Taj Samudra. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Club room, with all its facilities such as the High Tea and the evening drinks. Our room was very comfortable as well as the courteous staff. The varied menu for breakfast and dinner was very delicious. Everything was beyond our expectations"
taj-samudra, 10 ,Everything! 
taj-samudra, 7.5 ,Location was very good .. Sea facing  It was very busy .. it does not have Spa
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Staff were 1st rate and incredibly nice everywhere throughout the hotel. the wide range of facilities and restaurants available at all times Room service was wrong, and told us that they were right. we ordered ice coffee twice and both times got hot coffee"
taj-samudra, 10 ,Excellent customers service and friendly staff especially Shemila/Berni and Natasha very helpful.I'm one of very satisfied customer.I'll come again.Thank you
taj-samudra, 8.0 ,Food was good but had very limited options in vegetarian
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Excellent location in the heart of the city and with beautiful Galle Face views.Dining and food options are just superb - the quality and variety of food at the buffet breakfast and dinner was incomparable to anything else I have tried far in Sri Lanka, and we travel frequently there.Service standard was very high.Rooms were lovely and well-appointed - we are usually loyal guests at other hotels in Colombo, and this was our first stay at this hotel - we will definitely be back.Thank you for looking after us and for a wonderful stay! The only service which was below quality was the private driver who drove us for a few hours - he had a por attitude, and it did not match with the rest of the hotel."
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"Bf buffet tasty specially srilankan string hoppers curries and sambols 
And the swiming pool beautiful and clean  Food bit spicy and influenced by Indian flevours which we dont like "
taj-samudra, 10 ,"Very spacious

taj-samudra, 10 ,"Excellent , personalised customer service from the point of checkin until after checkout. 
Praiseworthy room ambience and comfortable bed which made our stay that much sweeter. 
Room service was prompt and courteous. 
In-room dining experience was warm and delectable. 
The food was delicious as always and the dinner buffet was scrumptious. 
On the whole, the staff did not fail to keep up the infamous reputation of The Taj despite the prevalent Covid-19 surveillance. 
"
taj-samudra, 10 ,"High quality facility
Amazing hospitality and food I liked it all"
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"Excellently maintained property , great location , Great food and service . Leakage in the wash basin."
taj-samudra, 10 ,The concierge and his staff were entirely amazing.  Anushka helped me to get a replacement charging cable when I left mine in India - he made several calls to locate the right product for me - over and above the required level of assistance!  The staff in general at this hotel were superb!  Lovely friendly faces at all times- this is very helpful on a long business trip. The hotel drivers are not the most reliable - they don't use Google maps and they don't know where they are going :-(
taj-samudra, 9.6 ,Great location. Great property. Great service. 
taj-samudra, 9.0 ,"Brilliant staff, so helpful and attentive.Wonderful location with beautiful sea views. The food could be better. As I can’t eat spicy food, I really struggled with the food in general.Perhaps you need more international options rather than focusing on Indian cuisine."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,"Service and the food was really good.Try to work on the neighborhood of it’s possible because some of the roofs around distract the view"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"The view is absolutely amazing,
the decor of the place is cute and charming, the staff is very friendly and available and the location is perfect !
We recommended it already to other tourists going to Ella we met on our trip!
(Just make sur to fix the doorknob of Unit I) "
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,We absolutely loved our stay at the hideout! But more importantly the people are so friendly and made it even more enjoyable for us. The facility itself is amazing with spectacular views. It’s in such a great location which made it so much easier for us and getting around to places. We loved our stay here and will definitely stay again!!  Nothing that really comes to mind. 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,"Everything else at the property is perfect.
-The Views: you will not see a more iconic view in any other hotel room in Ella. The property is worth it just for the view alone.
- The attention to aesthetic detail: the room is very pretty and instagrammable. 
- The staff: the staff were amazing and attentive. The food was great too. You have the option to have dinner or breakfast on your balcony which overlooks Nine Arch Bridge. It's magical I'd give The Hideout Ella a 10 but the sealing around the property needs addressing. It's a wood cabin with exposed gaps which means that anything from mosquitoes to rodents have access to your room. Which can give you a little fright in the middle of the night 😣. 
Also, the shower wasn't very hot and you don't get much  protection when you do shower. Expect water everywhere after you shower. Which isn't great especially because this is made from wood."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,"The view from the room is insane. I didn’t want to leave the room because of how beautiful the view was! The cabins are so cute and private you feel like your in your own little world. There are two cabins in total, it is run by a family who are the cutest! They have a tuctuc onsite which is very useful as the property is a bit out the way so it comes in very handy! Breakfast is lovely! And very filling. The WiFi didn’t work at all: not a major problem but seems to be commom We had a power cut and weren’t offered anything for compensation. The shower was freezing and I couldn’t shower in the end!All of the above did not ruin our stay at all, just minor things that would have made our stay exceptional that’s all!"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 8.0 ,The property was nice and good. Food was excellent as well the dinner prepared on our special request was exceptional. Really enjoyed the place.  Owner need to work on the drainage system. Shower area water draining is very slow. 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 7.9 ,"Amazing location- views are amazing. You are in the middle of the jungle, overlooking the nine arch arch bridge. 
You can watch the sunrise in the morning from the bed and listen to the sounds of nature
The bridge is 10 minutes away (ask locals about the shortcut). You can take a stroll by the Finlays tea factory and get a view of the other side of the valley and sip a cold drink at the 98 Acres cafe. From there you can take the hike to the Little Adam’s Peak (you will walk by the Ravana Zip line) opposite the Ella rock.
We got some complimentary tea a juice in the morning.
The ride from town costs about 400 lkr one way so we rented a motorbike for one day - they have it ready at the property.
They can also arrange laundry service- clothes came back clean, fresh smelling and ironed.
We enjoyed our stay here. Take into consideration that this is a cabin made from wooden planks in the middle of the forest. This means insects, cold nights, lot of animal sounds all night and morning. The sun will wake you (or the passing trains) early in the morning.
 Also there are lot of details that are not yet finished or were overlooked (missing shelves in the closet, bath room door is difficult to open,..,). Do not expect a 5 star hotel.
"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"We really enjoyed staying in such a nice place! The view is great, you can see from there the nine Arch bridge!! 
the Apartment was super clean and there were no insects. 
I would totally recommend to stay here to enjoy the nature!! 
Moreover, they helped us to find a privat taxi driver with a reasonable price!
One of the most beautiful places we have been so far in Sri Lanka"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,The staffs were very sincere. They gave me compliment in everything; dinner & breakfast were free. The view was fantastic overlooking the 9 arch bridge. They shouldve built more rooms.
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.2 ,The view !! Awesome and Stunning View 😍
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,Excellent Wonderful place
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,"AMAZING view!!!  It's quite a small space but beautifully done. Very close to most of the key Locations in Ella. Very relaxing and an amazing stay! Also, we were offered a complimentary ride to a secret water fall, which was amazing! The bathrooms could have been a bit better."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"Such an amazing experience! Incredible view overlooking nine arches.Lovely staff providing everything we needed,including an absolutely first rate meal from the lovely family from the restaurant above! Will be recommending this to all our friends 🏔❤️ Can honestly say there was nothing we didn’t love"
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,Amazing views! Cozy appartment. There was no hot water in the room..it was just warm.

hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,The location was tucked away and the view was amazing! The room was comfortable and clean. We had an amazing time!  The shower wasn’t hot for the cool climate at night. 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 8.3 ,"Everything was nice! It was too cold!! Maybe we were unlucky with weather, I don’t know. "
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 8.0 ,"The views are stunning, location is close to Nine Arch Bridge. Cabin is pretty cosy and nice place to stay If you really want some getaway from people and crowds. Nice place for a couple stay. We didn't mind meeting any mosquitos, but the mouse in our cabin was a suprise, running through the bathroom. Actually, few of them were eating our chips during the first night. Second night we managed to put all our stuff in bags, we put any food away and It was much better. Also, If there's anyone staying in the second cabin - you can hear everything what's happening in there."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 8.3 ,The view was very beautiful as expected. It is a good place for short stay. Nice to hear the nature surrounding you while you sleep. Not too far away from town. It was handy that there was tuk-tuk driver available on site.  
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,❤️Loving Lobby areas ❤️
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,"The location was awesome. It is situated in the hills facing the mountain side. Also It has a Great view of the Nine arch Bridge.its a unique wooden building . When  enter in you get a amazing feeling. Its so different than other normal rooms. Rooms are so comfy and have all the basic facilities like TV ,WiFi,  kettle etc. They even have a swing in the room. The room service was so good. Staff are super friendly and helpful. You can ask him anything and he will do it for you with out any problem  he is so nice and helpful.  They provide a good breakfast and we can order rest of the meals for a good price.Its a busy place. Getting a booking is very difficult . So the staff are so busy during checkout. Only problem we had was the cleanliness of the table in the room . It had coffee stains all over it . When we pointed it  out to the room service boy  cleaned it well with a happy face . He was awesome and super helpful. Other thing was the hot water shower. The temprtautre adjusting part was broken . So the water doesn't get heated that much. It needs some repair. The building need some maintainance.  Due to covid19 the tourism side took a blow and they have to slash the price and offer it for a very cheap price  . So we understand the difficulties in maintaining the property and to do repairs .but its not a big issue .  Over all the staff are so good and friendly. What ever we requested they did it for us. And the stay was awesome We enjoyed the stay in the cabins. I really recommend this place. "
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 8.0 ,Place is exceptional. View is amazing. Recommend this place. You can see the Nine Arch from the room.  Could be improved.. Breakfast is bit less varieties but fine. 
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"Loved the amazing view 
Very cozy and romantic ambience

hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 10 ,"The view and the design of the place got us. A comfortable place. Good facilities such as a good wifi connection, a smart TV. A good value for money. No air conditioning facilities or heater facilities. There is a fan but that's not enough. No proper ventilation as well. There were some bugs in the bed."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 8.0 ,"The room is super comfy and very spacious. Not every sound proof, you can hear what the next room people talk about."
hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,Everything was perfect about the rooms. But they need to be a bit more maintained. The person who was in charge there wasn’t so friendly. He did everything we asked for but wasn’t so friendly.

hideout-ella-wood-cabins, 9.0 ,"The view and the continental breakfast.
Warm cabin is dull of romance. They overcharged me. $5
Morning water was cold due to a electrical failure."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,"Food was good. Staff was very unprofessional.
We weren't offered a welcome drink.
Could clearly see kitchen staff checking out on guests and making comments in Sinhalease so the guests wouldn't understand.
Morning breakfast was a disaster. Staff was having a good gossip session near the buffet. A cheff later joined in and started on the drinking session they had the previous night.
After breakfast, when going back to the room, noticed room service staff singing in the corridor in a way which made us feel unsafe."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,Beach is really nice Receptionist haven’t greetings well and did not offered face towel they offered for others.It’s so slow for the checking need to waited long to get a room. Provided a too old room far corner to the hotel and at the entrance of the door trash bin. It was with Rusty and still sand on the steps and shower curtains has out from the hooks. WiFi wasn’t good at all. I was refused to stay at the property and then they offered me a room. It wasn’t showen a manger or supervisors to discuss. Staffs need to be well train and they chit chatting with some favorites only. Citrus is a good brand name that’s why I decided stay unfortunately left with bad  memories.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,Awesome place... great view.... lovely rooms. Nothing
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.0 ,location Food... just horrible.

citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,"The view, the breakfast and proximity to beach. The showers, the bathroom condition, the time the pool closes way too early and it should be heated. The beds were not comfortable. The staff when checking in were not hospitable."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.3 ,"Food Customer service, front office staff should be organised and some female staff are very rude, the pool attender was discriminating against locals."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.4 ,The French fries we ordered. it is value for money The check-in time is 2.00 PM. We went there at 1.45. One room key was given to us at 3.00 PM and the other 3.20 PM. No welcome drink served to the waiting guests. The rooms are very small and no chair to sit. No lift to climb up to 4th floor.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"I had my birthday all the staff made it a wonderful night and the chef made the cake and presented it on the night.Felt very special.The art work was very good."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,Friendly staff Not cleaned and not comfortable
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.4 ,"Breakfast is very good. Wash room smells awful and water leaks ,"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.2 ,The rooms were amazing with great views and good space. The location is a stones throw away from the beach and the uber cool salty swamys cafe. The mattresses were extremely soft and not good for people with even the slightest back trouble. The sheets are thin and had to ask for extra blankets in the middle of the night.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,"Beach access
Good breakfast 
 Staff didnt turn up untill 3 times after saying yes to request on phone for room service 
Bathroom stinks
Ac smells very bad and unhygienic 
Shower water enters room"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.6 ,"Great view from the property, awesome location and with almost all facilities. The property is right on Hikka beach and surrounded by market. The property is quiet and has sounds only from the ocean. They have a great spa and a good selection in buffet. The staff is prompt, great and helpful. Take up a room with a sea view and the stay will be awesome. We booked a sea view room, but they offered us a an eco room which has the view of the restaraunt. We raised the issue with the management and they could only upgrade us to  our room the next day. They were nice enough to compensate us with complimentary stuff to make our stay comfortable. The bathrooms are a bit small which makes the stay a bit uncomfortable"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,"breakfast was good pillows smelling badtoilet water leakstoilet walls are not cleanedbuffet had a limited selectionno baby pool"

citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,Request double bed but received two single beds. Very disappointed😥
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,Everything! Food.was spot on! And staff was really friendly amd helpful! Will definitely go back !
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.2 ,Spacious and comfortable room with all the amenities you would expect. Got a beautiful view of sunset from the balcony. Serves great food at the restaurant.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,"The entrance and lobby are amazing and the pool was lovely too but not enough sun beds for all the guests and the ground by the pool was slippy and I slipped and landed on my back on day 1. Not a single person approached me to ask if i was ok, not staff nor tourists. What has happened to humanity??? I had to pick my self up off the ground and take myself to my room! The breakfast was great but you had to be early to enjoy the full range of food otherwise you're out of luck.  The beach by the hotel isn't really suitable for swimming either it's very rough with rocks and strong current.
We had an ok stay but I wouldn't recommend or indeed go back myself. I didn't like expecting a Sea view room only to check in and being taken downstairs to the back of the hotel to find a dark pokey room right beside the kitchen. The rooms were shabby and small and in need of refurb. there were cockroaches too! The bathroom was also in need of refurb. and it smelled, both bathroom and also our room, a stale smell.  I immediately asked to be moved but had to wait til the next morning to get the Sea View room I had booked!"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,A beautiful relaxing location by the sea.  24h a day sounds of sea. Good Pool. Sun loungers. Food selection. Polite staff. We had a relaxing week in the sun. A welcome break from city life.  Having an all inclusive band but having to sign for everything. I think it just needs to be either AI band or signing for all. I understand why but there's no need for the band as all 'purchases' are itemised.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.2 ,"Great staff hotel staff very professional and well trained in customer service. Room was the best accommodation we had stayed in in a resort during our whole time in Sri Lanka (Book the superior room with ocean view) Better wi-fi, could not swim in front of the hotel as there were rocks in the shallows. We booked a snorkelling tour with the diving school on site in the hotel grounds to say it was one of the worst experiences I have had would be an understatement. We paid 20 dollars each for three people the staff informed us the visibility was good but we could not even see your hand in front of you and at first suggested that we paddle board out to the snorkelling area which was a kilo meter away in 1 to 2 metre waves and strong currents. When we said no they took us on a tuk tuk ride to the nearest beach and we crossed without a snorkelling guide and just the captain of a canoe outrigger without any life jackets, so much for the snorkelling tour!!You can book the same snorkelling tour(bring your own gear) for 6 to 8 dollars if you talk directly to the captains which are plentiful on the beach."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.5 ,Sea view 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.4 ,The air conditioner was hot and they didn’t fixed 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"Food, the rooms Nothing"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.3 ,nothing this is not value for money none
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.4 ,"Staff were super nice and approachable. Mold in the the shower, staff entry was next to the room so it was noisey in the mornings. There wasn’t any value for money. Not 4 star rating at all!"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.3 ,Nothing Everything 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.3 ,"Nothing It was a total disaster. The people working in the hotel were very rude all the time. When we had questions they didnt try to understand us. The rolms were horrible. Very dirty. The bathrooms with ants and insects. The bad dindt had padded. I dont recomend this hotel under any circunstance!"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"The buffet breakfast was lovely. The staff always went above and beyond. They were so friendly and welcoming all the time, they really cared about you. You couldn't ask for a better location. They also have a generator so the A/C stays on all night :) We booked a room for three people. There was a cot brought in which was comfortable for a cot. However there was very limited space then in the room. Certainly not a total buzz kill though."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,"Location was great, rooms were comfortable. The staff couldn’t care whether you were there or not, we had several things go wrong and left with 1 night left."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"Amazing location. Heavenly view from the balcomy of the room. Good pool, fantastic restaurant. Very clean and extremely comfortable. Water pressure in the bathroom shower is very low."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.2 ,Wonderful location. Sea facing view from room is great. Special thanks to the head chef who personally catered to needs of all guests. Every day made an effort to understand the preferences & prepared the menu accordingly. Rooms are slightly dated. Needs an uplift. Housekeeping team to be more proactive in providing towels & toiletries without the guests asking for it specifically.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,Location is bang on Beach.. We played beach volleyball and spent time sitting near sea..
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,"Room smelt nice and nice pool Staff didn’t speak much EnglishHave to ask for towels for bathroomOnly a sheet on the bedLift was unpredictableBreakfast was rubbish"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,"The pool and access to the beach. Great location, Good breakfast. Firstly, this is the worst 3/4 star hotel I have stayed. Even normal hotels are professional and provide better services.The television has just 15 channels out of which 10 doesn't work. Room service is the worst. They had given floor towels to use. After complaining they replaced it with the right ones.  Beware, people should check if the right set of towels are provided. The restaurant closes by 11 PM which is weird for a star hotel. People do not understand what you want to order. It's really frustrating when you keep repeating the same thing and still, they don't get it. Rooms are very basic and small. Lights are dingy - looks more like a dance bar setting. The worst part is that the beds are loose fitted and makes some weird noise every time you move on the bed. The toiletries are some local made better not to use them."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.4 ,The location is the best part of this hotel and he manager is probably the most helpful person around. The breakfast is good and the restaurant food is value for money too. The room was basic. A deluxe room just had a bed and two chairs. No towels were provided. Had to beg the hotel staff for hours to get towels.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.4 ,"Whilst the facilities were ok, the staff were very unhelpful and often quite rude (minus the bar staff on the beach). We repeatedly had to ask for towels in our room and despite ringing numerous times- still didn’t receive them until we stood and waiting for over 30 minutes for them to be handed to us. Checking out was poor- and feedback was laughed at."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,Pool Bathroom & room
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"Excellent location right infront of the beach, really nice views from the room. Dinner and breakfast buffet had many varieties. Pool was good. Nice swings by the beach. Really good value for money. Interior of the rooms can be a bit improved."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,Well photos are manupulative.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.0 ,"Pool, the beach was clean, lunch and breakfast set menus were great and the atmosphere was very family friendly Cleanliness needs improving, dinner was absolutely aweful. Staff could have been more attentive. Bed was not at all comfortable. My pregnant wife was not at all impressed. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,"Proximity to the beach Cleanliness, out of date"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.6 ,good quality with lovely staff - thanks for a lovely stay.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,"Location. Old, need investment on property. Very unclean around their backyard. Specially behind main hall...  food is not good. Spread is very poor. No bacon on the morning "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,Location is good. Easy access to beach. Staff is friendly  Room and buffet was average. Not much comfortable. 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,Location and beach The rooms were aged and the tiles in the bathroom were cracked. Food was average and lacked fresh sea food being a beach front resort. Quite a shame.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"The location and facilities at Citrus are very good, large modern pool & beachfront, we stayed in room 216 & had a nice 1st floor balcony view overlooking pool & beach. Staff were very friendly, check-in was great, cold face towels provided & welcome drink. There are no lifts and we had surfboards so request 1st floor if you have a lot of luggage. Bar fridge was very handy in room. Breakfast was a good selection of hot & cold options. We stayed over 2 public holiday days and alcohol is not served at all, you’ll need to BYO to your room for this. Staff were helpful in organizing a driver for us. Poolside lunch was fabulous and great value. Overall a very pleasant stay. Very suitable for families with children. Service was a little slow at times."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.6 ,The view from the hotel. The swimming pool. The swing on the beach was an excellent idea! They also have a kid's corner. There was no fan in the room. Just an automated ac. Which is difficult to manage with a baby. Also the restaurant needs more fans. It's gets really hot during the day.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,This was our second time at this property.. located conveniently in a area with good restaurants and shops.. staff was attentive and friendly..  N/A
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"Direct see view.

Cleaned environment.
Beautiful place.  TV was tuned for only few chanels"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,"location  1. parking lot was full so we had to park outside the hotel (side of the main road)
2. I booked three standard room with the sea view but when the gave us the rooms was on the basement and not good standard (once we complain they just gave new rooms like they knew this would happen)
3. they have mentioned in the booking that there is Wifi every where in the hotel but when we get to the rooms, Wifi was not working and once we complained they just said its not working and it won't be fixed today.
bad bad experience 🥵"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"The location of the hotel was excellent, just beside the sea!The rooms were very comfortable and the food was incredibly great!"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"The staff was very friendly. The location is pretty good. The room looks a little old, no mini bar as stated. The room space is bit small as well as the bathroom space. The food wasn't that delicious with a little buffet."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.8 ,"The beach was good, right next to the property. There is a small coral like reef which breaks the waves to its really good place just to relax. Other than that the only good about the hotel was the service provided by one particular waiter named Sajith. If you do visit look for him in the restaurant. Where do I even begin? Overall my say at Citrus Hikkaduwa was horrible. I would think twice about revisiting Citrus Hikkaduwa. THE ROOM : overall there is nothing wrong with the aesthetics of the room, it was positioned right above the pool and overlooking the sea. However, the bed was horrible. Imagine a double bed with two single mattresses. One of the mattresses was worse than the other and this is not something I expected from such a reputed hotel. In addition, my room was also the closest to the hotel restaurant area that hosted a DJ, I could hear the loud music in my room till about 11pm.THE FOOD : This was the most disappointing of all. When I checked in, I was told that the dinner service would be from 7.30pm to 10.30pm. So my wife and I went down for dinner at around 8.45. To my surprise most of the items on the dinner buffet were empty. I waited for around 5 minutes while having my soup to see if they were being refilled, however as this was not being done I ate was there. Severely disappointed and fuming I confronted the executive chef who walked into the dining hall while I was having dessert. Then he took the initiative of refilling the food, but by then I had finished eating. The Breakfast was ok, nothing too fancy. I've personally had a better breakfast at my local SPAR supermarket.THE BATHROOM : The bathroom looked dull and old is not something you expect from such a hotel. THE BAR : We walked into the bar area at around 6.30pm on a Friday. We had to search for the bartender for a good 10 minutes before he turned up. In addition, they were out of mint leaves for mojitos. I would expect something like this on a weekday when there isn't much demand but not on a Friday eve. Summary: This property has great potential to be a great hotel, but fails to live up to the hype.PS : They offered me a small cake as a consolation for what I had to experience."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.2 ,"Nothing Staff not professional , hotel rooms need to be updated , ac not working , sliding door broken , food equal to a budjet motel"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.0 ,Sea view

Breakfast buffet was also great selection Shower curtains weren’t great "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"Clean Rooms. 
Really cozy beds. 
Loved the balconies facing the beach. They have the most fantastic views. 
Breakfast was a buffet. I loved the fusion breakfast with many options and action counters. Loved my stay with Citrus Hikkaduwa. Definitely going back there again soon.  Nothing to Dislike.Absolutely Fabulous Place."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.8 ,"In general, the hospitality of the staff should be appreciated. The room service was quick. The food was good. It would have been much better with a wide range of buffet choices. Compared to other hotels we have been in, the menu is somewhat reduced. The atmosphere of the hotel inside was not pleasing. It was more confined and compact than we thought. Definitely not a good place to stay in peacefully. There was not any note about the hotel service numbers inside the room. We had to call the hotel main line and asked, there to find the room service number. WIFI was poor in the room. The old 20 inch LCD TV has 6 channels only. there was not a single floor matte in the room."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,"THE BEST EVER BEACH RESORT.
          WOW, WOW, WOW!
The service comes first! Every single staff were smiling and willing to help! The service and the hospitality were just OUT OF THE WORLD. The management is very lucky to have Mr.Malinda Ranwala as the GM.His hardwork is absolutely evident.Mr. Dumida,front office manager was pleasant. The Executive Housekeeper Mr.Lasantha Dissanayake really made us feel at home . He made sure that the rooms were kept clean and tidy and also ensured that we were extremely comfortable and sorted out few request of us in a lightning speed.Mr.Nilanka, F&B department took special care of not only us but every single guest, with personal care( we were watching).There are so many names to mention! The Location is SUPER AWESOME! This trip to CITRUS HIKKADUWA was a complete  body and mental rejuvenation for us. Not to forget The Balinese girl Ongo for her professional services to our family( sorry if the name is spelled wrong)! The DINNER by the beach was just Brilliant ! GUYS! You are rocking !! Keep it up !  I AM PREBOOKING MY STAY FOR DECEMBER (FOR A WEEK )!!
PS: Special mention to Chamal,Asanka,Dhanska & Maya.
The citrus aqua team was extremely professional in teaching us to surf.

citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.0 ,"Location was great Room was really very basic. Interiors were worn off, washrooms were pathetic"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,"Only the location was good. The rest of the hotel, food and service was bad Service was poor. Food was not up to the mark. Rooms were too old. No value for the money."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.6 ,"Location was good but not worth the premium. They have not planned room allocation well in spite of one month advance fully paid booking. They allocated room to family in different blocks. We were forced to take states two floor down and then climb again to go to room of other family members as the hotel does not have lift. Front office staff was too rude. Especially Ms Vathsala, the front office incharge behaved badly and was indifferent to our request stating that you have come with large family it’s your problem. 
We reached property at 3:00 pm but we were provided room in different blocks at 5:00 pm. Due to delay in room allotment we missed sun set. By the time we freshen up and came down, swiming pool was closed. Only property around to close swimming pool at 7 pm. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,Breakfast was great. We had a fantastic room with an ocean view. Staff were friendly and the resort pool was great. Very relaxing! 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.8 ,"Front desk, room service, specifically the location of the hotel was really good.wifi, hot water was totally fine. Good breakfast.  Comfort level in room was less.

citrus-hikkaduwa, 5.0 ,"The staff in the restaurant and the pool attendant. Extremely friendly and welcoming  The loud noise. Construction both sides of the hotel, in the hotel, and by the pool. Then loud music until after midnight. Noise from the road. Absolutely awful. We spent the day at another hotel to get away from the noise. A complete robbery of our money. Ask yourself if you’d pay to stay on a construction site for a weekend? Never again. Disgusting. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 3.5 ,"They have beautiful beech area  Room Not clean, no television, they changed my room category "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.5 ,The beach and the swing was excellent. Food at the club house was amazingly good. Try the Egg Cheese and Tomato Rotty. Hotel didn't go to sleep at 10 pm like most of the SriLankan hotels do. They were buzzing even at 1.00 am and visitors looked really happy and staff was very helpful. Badly in need of a refurbishment.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"Location was great. The pool was excellent for the children and allowed supervision from the pool side. No trees obsured the view of the pool. The hotel took the payment prior to arrival. Check in took 1 hour. No reasons or updates given. Room was damp and smelt musty without the AC constantly on super cold. Only bed sheet provided and the room was cold even without AC.Housekeeping always had to be asked for something. It was as if they were constantly reminding you they were there."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 10 ,Friendly staff and foods
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.0 ,"Great view of the beach with lounging chairs under trees. Booked a deluxe through Booking.com. Went to the hotel in the evening to find out that they haven’t received the confirmation and the hotel is overbooked for the night. 
Since refunding is not an option two standard rooms were shown to choose from for the same price. Additional bed was small and didn’t come with pillows. Had to ask for everything separately. Several buffet options were available for breakfast but disorganized and didn’t look clean. Didn’t taste good either. Maybe because the place was crowded but it’s definitely not worth the money spent. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 4.0 ,room is very clean. staff was very friendly people breakfast was horrible.

3. I am not sure if this was in all the rooms but in our triple bed room there were no plug points next to the bed 
4. The inner of the lift is made of wood and the wood has gone bad due to the humid and it stinks "

citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,"We found ants in the room and called reception response was actually really quick and they were very attending to our request 
The location of the hotel was perfect where everything was literally next to us whether it was restaurants, supermarkets,  exchange offices and even shops to buy some souvenirs  The staff was not fully aware of what do on occasions it was my wedding anniversary and I had sent a note 2 weeks before my arrival and there was follow up by booking.com with no response. Even when I came personally during my check-in i tried to explain to the front office and still no result, thought it might be the language barrier so with the help of my local tour guide he called 3 times to get the message across!!
As for the facilities the only thing I didn't like is that the hotel mentioned you are 1 minute from the sea/ocean  which is true and made the view magical however they did not mention anything about the inaccessibility of swimming in the sea due to the many rocks and corals near shore "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,"we just stayed a very short while and it was very nice, specially the Staff Nuwan Raj and Dilshan"

- Beach
- Attentive staff - We had booked a see view room for two nights, but when we arrived, we have been told that the hotel was fully booked and so we couldn’t have a room with a see view. So we had a view on the restaurant/bar, very noisy and irrelevant
- the bedding smelled moisture
- we saw big cockroaches on the balcony
- the rooms are very noisy
- no hot water
- too expensive for the few services proposed"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,Food is very tasty and surrounding sea beach is very nice and the staff is very friendly Very close to galle road and as there are no soundproofing it's little bit noisy
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,Breakfast was yummy Bathrooms need an upgrade
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,Staff very helpful and great location Need more shade for the loungers no parasols
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,"Room is comfortable, personal is friendly, breakfast was good with big choice of food.  Ocean in front of hotel is not suitable for swimming, but they don't allow to take towels outside hotel. 
In my opinion it is slightly overpriced"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,The location overlooking the beach and the setup. Staff is friendly n prompt. Breakfast elaborate.  Rooms were a bit oldish; bathrooms need renovation 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,Location overlooking beach and outdoor is very nice. Staff quite friendly. Breakfast elaborate  Rooms were a bit oldish. Bathroom could be much better. 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,The pool and location The staff were rude to my Sri Lankan friends unfortunately.  It took several times of asking to have a baby cot in the room despite this being the initial booking.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,"Beaches , location...ok. The room wasn' t very clean. Old furniture...the bathroom was very small , not clean."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,Perfect location and great variety In food with amazing taste. Everything was perfect 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,"Nice pool, very good breakfast. Location is perfect Although a sea-view room was paid, it was not available for our first night. Management of the hotel simply gave us a key from a garden-view room. After some complaints from our side they offered complimentary lunch as apologize with upgrade to the sea-view room the next day.  Not a great choice of not-spicy food"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,Near beach All good
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,The location and the comfortable rooms. Nothing that we didn't like
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,Dinner and breakfast had a fairly good variety and they tasted good. Delux Room was clean but the bathroom had a bit tightly spaced arrangement. There's a reef just infront of the hotel so anybody who wants to have a swim in sea have to walk further to find a place. Personally I enjoyed the marine life in the reef.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,The pool and the restaurant
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,Amazing location right on the beach. One of the best in Hikkaduwa. 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,Food very delicious.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,Excellent Location for snorkeling and a swim in the sea. Can reach a excellent swimming location by a short walk. There are lot of small restaurant around the hotel Noice from the road.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,"The Hotel picture when booking was not the Hotel at this location. The hotel was right on the side of the through traffic with a small area for parking and for dropping off guests. The beech in front of the hotel was dangerous with or without children as the sandy beach dropped steeply into the 'crashing waves'. Not my idea of a relaxing walk! However, the crashing waves deafened the sound of the loud music that only the manager seemed to like. The whole idea of sitting beside the sea with a breeze and quiet music was totally lost with the LOUD and ANNOYING repetitive pounding noise. We asked for the noise to be turned down with many fellow guests giving the thumbs up. However, within minutes the volume was turned up. So we looked for other places to eat and were very pleased with what we found. I certainly would not recommend this hotel due to the noise, but one would hope that eventually someone in the management team might listen to the guests. All the staff were very pleasant and most helpful. Citrus certainly does not make good use of their location, their facilities or their staff. Yours sincerely. See above!"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"Small bathrooms, very limited tv channels.
The dinner buffet wasn’t as expected. Attentive front desk staff. Pool and beach very close by."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,"Great pool! Lovely views Bed bugs in room. Basic and old decor. Basic bathroom considering it is 4 star rated."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,Great beachfront location. Fabulous variety of food. Supermarket and money changer directly opposite resort. Would have preferred buffet dinner to start earlier than 7.30pm. Pool too warm
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,"Location, pool & near beach Wifi signal is very weak"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,Problem with the toilet in de baisment
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,"Sea view, staff and services, foods Pool, it is small"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"The pool and view was amazing. Great location. Very nice staff around the pool area. The room is mediocre but I kept reminding myself how cheap the room was. You get what you pay for. The mattresses were the worst I’ve experienced at any hotel. Some staff was incredibly helpful but we did run into a few that didn’t want to help us with anything. We ate at the resturaunt one night and ordered the calamari which was cold and when asked to heat it up, the waiter touched the food to feel it was cold. At that point we just told them we didn’t want it. He did end up taking it off the bill but wasn’t happy about it at all."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,"Nice staff! Terrible surf rent at aqua Citrus (asked for a longboard, they gave us a 20 years old short board!) and called it for beginner board! Expensive The room has not been taking care of the last decade!"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"Very good location; very nice dinner and good breakfast in the hotel's restaurant. The second room was not ready and not available when we arrived - children were put in lower class room for the first night.

citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.5 ,"location,beach room AC not worked properly .informed several times once came and not solved the problem. room has no fan so it was very stuffy and no good sleep. otherwise this is a good hotel.my room tv not worked they changed a new one after taking hours to fix it but no tv channels to watch"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"Food was good both dinner and breakfast.
The staff was friendly. The bed spread n pillows didn't feel fresh.
Toiletries were missing in one room.
The music was loud while dining in the evening."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,"Good location, good views from the room. very beautiful beach. Friendly staff. Good food. Bit expensive for a 3 star hotel. Should have more floor mats for the rooms and corridors given it’s a beach resort as floors get dirty easily. Good food but expensive buffet. Should include more traditional SriLankan food for foreigners to enjoy."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,The hotel was good but the rooms are not updated and those are bit lack in cleanness. should have more comfort in the rooms … I have asked for a double bed yet I got 2 beds adjacent together.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,breakfast offer and arrangement of lunch room so good. activity of beach side the offer . improve the cleaning of kettles and knife
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,"Location great, pool fabulous, staff friendly and very helpful.The views of the beach are incredible! Great sunsets :) Rooms are a little tired, the breakfast options could be be improved. Noise was the worst as the bass makes rooms above shake! The wedding and party on 2 of our 4 days here, plus repair work most days so pool time wasn’t as peaceful as we were wanting. Probably bad luck on our part but very disappointing."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"Location was super awesome and room was superb and nicely arranged. Food in ala carte was good. But need improvements.  Staff need a very clear training to make sure CITRUS hospitality. Restaurant staff need a motivational program (Ex : Documents says restaurant open at 7am for breakfast and once I am there by 7.30am very rudely treated me) and bar people should behave in a way with a proper understanding of the product availability. Ex : Requested a Breakfast tea and served with a green tea.
Washrooms in the restaurants need a frequent attention than now. 
Pool towels need some improvements. 
Security personals should learn to treat local guests as well rather than ignoring us. 
Since I am local and not a so called money making machine staff treated me as a terrorist by not even smiling with me.
Beddings were old but clean. Bathroom need a refurbishment but was clean.
WiFi was stupid in the room and I used my own data rather than asking. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.7 ,"Location,food, pool Nothing looks like the pictures"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,"Location and value for money - bathroom was not clean when we checked in- there were issues with our booking which was related to booking.com and Citrus. I had place a request to reduce from 3 guests to 2 guests through booking.com. Booking.com claimed they told the hotel but didnt get a response. The hotel claimed they were never informed. Booking.com reached out again after we complained and the hotel refused to charge us for 2 instead of 3 as it was 'last minute'. We needed up paying for 3 people even though we were only 2 and had already requested the change way in advance."

citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,"Friendly staff, and a nice, comfortable room. A good selection of food at the breakfast and dinner buffet. Recommend the Sri Lankan food spread. It was the best! Could improve on cleanliness. When we requested for a glass to be brought to the room, they showed up with one that was not washed well at all, full of stains and a layer of muck."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,The Staff was very helpful and they made sure the trip was wonderful The resort was overcrowded during the day due to some day trips organised. Thus the pool area was very crowded.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,The staff was very friendly. Foods were good and nice location. The floor in the room was always wet. None of the channels were working properly on the TV. The double bed was actually two singled beds merged together.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,Room air conditioner working poor
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,The food was spicy but very tasty and we also met the Chef and mentioned it to him. The location is just awesome.  We got a good taste of local food and their authenticity. Childrens play area (for below 10 years) could be made cause other than the swimming pool and the swing there is nothing much for them to do.

citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,"Room was super comfortable and location is very convenient. View of the room toward the beach was excellent. Guest relation officer was super supportive to us. Facilities in the room was awesome. Hotel going through renovations so other than the room rest of the facilities going through developments which is a distraction to the holiday. Staff was having negative responding behavioral patters toward the guests specially to locals. Other than the guest relation officer, non of the staff member responded us in friendly manner. All were assuming, OH MY LOCALS, they are here to drop down the hotel. Starting from Pool attendant to room service staff need a very clear training program on how to respond guests. Food was limited, but for the category of the hotel they have done their best. Re painting needed for the hotel and facilities need to improve starting from Cutlery,"

The chicken soup at dinner was the only bad thing on the menu... hardly any chicken, mostly starch"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.5 ,"It had a big breakfast spread, lot's of choices for everyone's taste. Friendly staff and a nice looking pool, though we didn't get the chance to use it. Looked great from the outside, but the room itself was dated and just 'eh' for the money. The sliding doors out onto the balcony only opened with a real struggle so didn't use it much...and some serious construction going on right above us in the morning."

citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,Blankets need to be more comfortable. The bed.
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.5 ,"Both the dinner and breakfast buffets were the highlight of our stay. There was absolutely nothing we could fault here. Hats off to the chef and staff. Variety maybe could have been more. But what was available was very good. Secondly we enjoyed the long beach walks in the evening and morning. Romantic setting indeed. Good view from the balcony which faces the sea. The room was smaller than we expected from the pictures. The balcony did not have a wooden railing as shown, but had a concrete structure too high for us to sit and view the beach. Couple of necessary room amenities were missing and had to call room service to get it done. Room service should be more dynamic."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,"The location was really good and the breakfast was good. My room had a water leaking, while raining water came inside from roof. Hotel book/magazine mentioned about indoor playing games, but when I inquire from the staff they said it’s not available."

citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,Location was perfect- right on the beach and near all the shops and reataurants A little dated and could be cleaner
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,Good location and lovely staff. Thought it was over priced and the room could of been slightly cleaner. 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.0 ,Delicious buffet 😋
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.0 ,A/C not working properly
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,Good location and on the water.  Needed to ask for towels to be brought to the room. There were no “do not disturb signs” for your room. Hotel could use a facelift in general. 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.0 ,"Very good location. A lot of restaurants around hotel where you can eat, super market next to hotel and exchange (western union) with good rate next to hotel. Very good breakfast, nice pool, nice staff. horrible internet connection in the rooms - the only place where internet was working was hotels lobby. In the evenings lobby looks like internet cafe - all guests there. Prices in hotel's restaurant definitely overpriced. As we travelled with kids - there was not even 1 kids channel on tv - just cricket."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.5 ,"Everything  Nothing 
"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.1 ,"Location: right on the beach.
Nice pool.
Friendly staff. Unfortunately, even with a paid-for upgrade, the standard is very average.
Aircondioning: Very Good;
TV: Very Good
Deposit Safe: Very Good;
Meals: Very Good;
Internet: Woefully Inadequate and any attempt to “fix” it failed.
Overall, Citrus Hikkaduwa disappointed. Having travelled around Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, I was expecting more from Citrus. I thought the overall standard of the accommodation was unsatisfactory. Great view, but creature comforts are missing. Citrus looks tired and to have seen better days. If I had my time over again, I would pay more and go to “Hikkaduwa Tranz by Cinnamon”, 200 metres up the road. Beautiful lush gardens, boating, diving, upmarket accommodation and fabulous restaurant (I tried the crab risotto and it was great).
Citrus cannot compete on room standard or facilities. I suspect it is attractive because of its price but be warned, this is back-packer-type accommodation with no frills."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,Their cleaning was not good
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.0 ,Nice to stay with a sea view  Food isn’t Sri Lankan dishes 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.0 ,Friendly staff & tasty foods
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.0 ,"For what you pay, could not fault anything the room and hotel was everything it said it would be and the house keeping team did a wonderful job. Breakfast was very tasty, and location superb. Wifi was'nt the best but believe that was being fixed whilst we were there."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.5 ,1. I do not have WiFi in rooms ( I booked 2 rooms).                                                                     2. Air-conditioners does not worked correct (only fix temperature more then 24 degrees of Celsius)
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.9 ,"The location is right on the beach, easy access to surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach. Very convenient location, and good service overall."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,The location and the view. Also the beach is awesome.  Excellent for families 
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.8 ,"Location was perfect for both Beach and shopping. Spacious and relaxed.
All the staff were happy, smiling and helpfull.
We had a room with stairs from the balcony the pool-area/garden, which was perfect when travelling with a toddler who needs a nap in the day. They were playing russian techno at dinner one evening - though most of the clientel were elderly or families. Dinner-music would be more suitable."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 6.2 ,"Location is great  It really needs a revamp and the food was really poor, which is unusual for Sri Lanka. "
citrus-hikkaduwa, 8.3 ,"Location, pool, kids friendly"
citrus-hikkaduwa, 7.0 ,"Amdeance is okay but too expensive. Hotel rates was too much for the facility

citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.0 ,"I stayed for 2 nights and highly appreciate the COVID safety measures in place throughout the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, especially Damith and Ishrak were really supportive. Foods were tasty. The food outlet which was recently put up in front of the hotel has quite some tasty local foods varieties as well. Nothing to complain."
citrus-hikkaduwa, 9.0 ,This was my 5th stay and as always superb Staff and good atmosphere I can’t complain cos they have to do things according to COVID regulations

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.8 ,"Service very very poor. Many guests complaining every day about lack of staff one pool waiter for entire area 50 mins to get water or coke brought Lazy dinning staff leaving dirty tables not clearing them off. Walk past and leave An Asian man standing pool side clearing his throat and nose and spitting in pool. 2 days in a row.   Complaint to hotel manager not even a response back. Disgusting. Many people around pool told the Asian man off he did not care. Repeated again next day  clearly management did nothing !!"

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.7 ,"Very poorly staffed. Constantly waiting for upto an hour for a drink. No organisation. Had to complain about an Asian clearing his throat and spitting in pool ! Staff not very concerned about this vile action Poor staff level and tile spent waiting for service"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.8 ,Very clean.  The rooms were not very spacious
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.7 ,"The hidden costs adding on by the hotel. We had booked our room at $840 AUD Only for them to charge my credit card $1,030 AUD due to hidden costs that weren’t mentioned online. Very disappointed"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.1 ,The location was great so was the hotel’s luxurious lobby but the rooms are very old styled and not well finished!
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 3.3 ,"The location was excellent I’ve stayed here before and it was a pleasant experience though not with kids at that time. These time I was with 3 kids between 6-1. I booked room that accommodate 3 adult 1 child and booking.com confirmed my selection, when I reached the hotel the staff insist I had to pay for extra bed and breakfast for my 6 year old. I told them I booked for 3 adult and showed them my confirmation they were so unhelpful and kept going back and forth with the manager. The guy later came back and told me it’s ok for the child but I will pay for breakfast for him which I said ok. The shock is when we got to the room which was so small, old and unkept. I knew we couldn’t stay there. Suddenly they called back from front desk and told me that the manager had change his mind and we must pay for extra child even though we r not getting extra bed and had to pay for his breakfast as well. I told them ok. I called booking.com and told them to cancel my entire stay I will check out in the morning. I will pay for 1 night been that it’s non-refundable booking.com made it happen. Long story short I was so happy to leave that hotel and I doubt I will ever consider them or recommend. Bad experience. "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.0 ,"London Grill and Chutney restaurants were excellent .Breakfast was good We were expecting a court yard meaning access to an outdoor space. Or room was on the 9th floor. I booked the room especially for a bathtub. Warm water was the hottest I could get.Room was hot to sleep in. Bed was short No place to plug in the hairdryer , the hotel management couldn’t help!!!!!"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.8 ,"Good size room Breakfast is mainly catered for Asian taste.Meeting room I booked was very poor.Lots of staff standing around, just saying hello."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.4 ,"Lovely hotel in great location.  The restaurants are excellent offering a wide variety of choices. The hotel is stunning with lovely grounds  Check in took over 20 mins. 
Our room (which was upgraded) stank. The smell coming through the aircon was horrible. 
The room was in need of redecorating. 
Check out process was also poor. 
I expect more from a 5star hotel. "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 2.9 ,"Just the lobby  Old building, worn out and very pricy "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.2 ,"Facility Staff, especially the people who handled the banquet for our workshop. They were unavailble at most times and were hard to reach out to or get help from.In room dining and room cleaning were average. They made a lot of mistakes with cleaning, providing basic help like cups, plates etc and sometime our order placed was not catered to and we kept waiting all night for the same."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.8 ,"I had higher expectations for a 5* hotel. The hotel probably requires renovation, as the price doesn't match the offer. I pay attention to things like slippers, shampoo and soap, and such small details, and they were unsatisfactory. The shower door did not close/latch properly, and water would flood the entire bathroom. The hotel is lacking in aesthetics when it comes to bathroom amenities. The gym is fully equipped and overlooks a nice green area, but the equipment was noticeably old. Out of the many restaurants, I tried Lagoon (Seafood), and it had a market feel. Whether that was deliberate or not, I can't tell for sure, but it didn't have a 5* hotel feel to it. Not faulting the cleanliness, but the waiting staff were so busy, it took 40 minutes for someone to explain how ordering food works around there. I would say, overall, it is a nice hotel, and the staff were very kind and helpful most of the time, but I'd rate it 4* instead of 5."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.7 ,In rooming dining options are limited. Also flexibility for infant food options are limited
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.7 ,Location and the restaurants Room  is too old and need to be updated

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 2.5 ,nothing at all staff locality their policy very bad food  very very very expensive  rude staff at reception not helpful at all never ever visit this hotel will never ever recommend thia hotel my score form 0   to   10    i will give not only zero but minus 0   -0
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.2 ,We informed them it was a wedding night and they messaged back saying they will cater us with arrangements but nothing was done.  
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.2 ,Location. Good breakfast spread. Decent size room.  Staff weren't friendly. Room service took far too long. Rooms weren't cleaned properly everyday. Initial few nights lots of bed bugs. Bathroom had lots of cracks in Bath tub. Shower curtain very outdated. 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.2 ,"The restaurants are good 
Reasonable price for a 5 star standard 
Premium wing is better than the courtyard wing 
 Check in-Check out process takes a lot of time 
The credit card machine does not accept payment in USD which is quite a surprise!
Lights in the room is quite less 
Soap and shampoo are very basic, not a 5 star standard! 
"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.0 ,"nothing Chef gave me burnt fried eggs, the toaster was not working. Waiter dud not pay attention to the order,I was shoved to a room with a pigeon hole bathroom with a shower that i wont even use for my dog. Is that the value for money charging 200USD per nite? I was put on a floor which was in another buliding where my colleagues were checked in."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.1 ,"Breakfast was excellent / location was good The attitude of the staff. We had booked premium rooms of 32 sq mt, but were given smaller rooms initially and only after a lot of insistence and persuasion were given the right rooms. It didn't need to be so difficult. We should have been given what we were promised. Even after bringing to the duty manager's attention that the rooms were smaller, they were not willing to acknowledge the same."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.0 ,Staff was clearly overworked and rude on many occasions. Rooms need to renovated.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.8 ,The pool and the staff at the pool were good Check-in took almost 1 hour. I landed at 10pm and was checking in at 12midnight. Was told by the duty manager that my room wasn't ready. Not sure how this could happen as the room I was supposed to be in was given to a honeymoon couple and their room to me. I know this because I have a cake and fruits in the room. I received a call stating that they needed to remove the cake and fruits as it was for the honeymoon couple and not me. You should have given me my room. Not happy with the service at all. Disappointing being a 5 star hotel and the duty manager was useless. I had to find my way to the lift as well. Breakfast was a disaster. Felt like a 2 star hotel. All I all I wont be staying here again.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 1.0 ,"Breakfast okay, cold hash browns.  No fresh Juices, No jacquizzi,  No temprature controlled swimming pool.  No play area for kids. Breakfast okay, cold hash browns.  No fresh Juices, No jacquizzi,  No temprature controlled swimming pool.  No play area for kids."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 4.0 ,"I am a very frequent visitor and I really enjoy the breeze bar and the staff there are excellent and some of the best I have seen in all the hotels in Colombo. This was around my 15th time to stay here and by far my worst experience in terms of the professionalism of the the manager Fabian. I had booked a standard room for one night and when I went to check in I was upgraded to the executive floor as I think all the other rooms were full, however the upgrade was only for the room and I wasn't aloud use the facilities on the 9th floor. next morning I decided to stay one more night and rang reception and asked that before I book can I stay in this room for one more night as if they want me to move then I will just move to a different hotel and they said ok we can stay in same room. I then get a call from the manger fabian at 9pm at night saying that we have not paid for that upgraded room and only the lower class room therefore we are going to have to move rooms. We never asked to stay in an upgraded room in the first place an din fact the upgraded room was smaller than the normal room so it was of no extra benefit to us since we were not allowed to use the 9th floor facilities. a serious lack of some common sense on this guys part, he made it sound like we were getting the room for free when I had spent 100k ruppess for the two night and the new year eve party and dinner and drinks. Most likely wont be staying here again after this and cinnamon lakeside instead all because of Fabian1"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 6.0 ,Staff helpful
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.8 ,The property is nicely done and feels good to be around but the room description in booking.com and what we got was different. I don’t like the mannerisms if the staff roof unware and never understood what we wanted.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.0 ,The breakfast spread was excellent. The service was poor at breakfast. The Space and the sitting needs urgent attention. Better Planning and execution at breakfast must improve. I understand the Taprobane Restaurant is still under repair after the Easter debacle. The reception services need improvement in speed  of services. The Indian and Chinese guests must be told to fall in line for service and not breaking the line for service.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.1 ,"The check in staffs may need some more training.They need to explain more about the hotel and the room inside.it wasn't busy when I checked in but still I have to find my way around the restaurant s and swimming pools
The breakfast was good. 
"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 4.6 ,"Front desk staffs are useless. They have no clue what is happening there. My debit card was not working so as an assurance I gave them 600 USD upfront with the commitment from the staff to get back the same money once my debit cards start functioning again. After I got my debit card problem sorted out with my bank and went to front desk to get my dollars back they said, they can’t give back the money since they have deposited in the bank. Which was quite shocking to me . Moreover they charged me upfront all the money at one go . Which I s not a usual practice for any hotel. The rooms are very small . Bathtub was full of crack. Useless hotel not worth paying so much of money. In the name of 5 star they are looting people 🤬"

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 5.0 ,"Although the breakfast range was less than previous years, The food was well prepared with sufficient refills and attentive staff each morning. There was a range of fruit juices serious cooked breakfast signature speciality local cuisine. One of the restaurants was not open at that time due to previous damage from the terrorist attack presumably. There were less restaurants available this time. Unfortunately I did have a bad experience having come from previous good rate recommendation and experience at Cinnamon Grand for my wedding. However I was accosted by senior members of staff including the marketing head for taking the photos in area despite being a paid customer. Your argument was that as I was that I will know anything at seven grand I wouldn’t be able to take pictures. Despite informing staff on my arrival and the night before that this will be occurring. There were no prohibitions from the manager duty. I was also somewhat disappointed by the double standards I was met by when other customers were clearly having their photos taken in the reception foyer without confrontation. This explains left a very sour taste and as a result to stay at Cinnamon Grand for future visits. There was no attempt to address the situation and apologise despite spending thousands of pounds on rooms for myself and I will look elsewhere for hospitality going forward."

Breakfast was Continental, all rooms size deluxe. and Diner choice of 14 restaurants on the property. catering for all your needs. Very large pool area but very noisy with crows and birds and loose kittens. Cannot relax or have your lunch at the pool side, without your food being snatched away by predators. I will not be staying at this hotel again."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.0 ,Loved the pool area. Very relaxing in a busy city. The people working there were friendly. Very tasty macarons in the cafe. Very good breakfast buffet including vegetarian pizza! Room was very clean and comfortable although we could hear a nightclub booming until the early hours but it was a Friday night. Check in and check out took quite a long time. Then our key card didn't work twice. Also when we asked about a car to the airport we were told 8000 then when we came to pay it was 10000 then we found out that a local company could do it for 3500. So things could be a bit confusing!
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.5 ,"The hotel  is well situated  and provides different types af transport within  easy reach. The breafast has wide range of foodstuffs Moreover the front line staff  is very friendly and efficient. A small shopping mall is attached to the hotel with a food court whereby gusts may stroll . The staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. The hotel can accomodate  several events at a time like wedding  reception  , conference etc....  This contributes to the hotel""s lively atmosphere. The cafe is s  good place to entertain friends with live music as background.  However the rooms appear old  and furniture requires an uplift. Overall  a very good hotel with minor issues for improvement. I would  strongly recommend this hotel for stay."

Your hotel couldn't provide any support after informing at the very begaining of the stay and finnaly my colleages needs to pay for four nights without staying rest two days as they needs to check out after two days.

She helped us with recommendations and we ended up trying most of the in-room dining menu!Shobi and the Jazz quartlet at the lobby were outstanding.Not withstanding a particularly annoying one named ""Nuwan"" from Housekeeping staff who hounded ( ""Did you write a review for me? "", "" Sir I am going to check internet(sic) NOW, when will you write a REVIEW for me ?"" ) us for Trip Advisor reviews and a few hopelessly incompletent but alarmingly snooty women at the reception, the staff was generally outstanding. We tried 6 of the14 restaurants and the food was good and service very good there.Staff makes or breaks a stay. A stay could be laced with Michelin Star restaurants but unmotivated, snooty staff can be a stinker.We have mixed memories from the Cinnamon Grand. Sahan SeneviratneIT ConsultantOttawa, Canada Nuwan from Housekeeping.

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"excellent location with excellent customer service The Taprobane restaurants can be seriously understaffed during busy periods. Management need to take a close look at it, they need at least 5/10 more people setting up tables and serving the guests"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,The exceptional personal service by the staff They should brush up on their admin booking
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"i didn't expect better things in there_ in terms of accommodation and in terms of foods. i wanted to view the sea/ocean from the window, but that could not be helped for obvious reasons."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,I have been staying in Cinnamon Grand for last several years and has been the my preferred and safe selection Rigid and inflexible time on check out request.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Great breakfast.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.5 ,"the staff were all polite and very helpful. my room were well cleaned and amenities were sufficient. enjoyed the breakfast very much which had offerings of European and local dishes."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Pool Bar at night - balmy breeze going through, Nothing really apart from the daily egg frying battle - staff didn't listen but did their own thing."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.9 ,"I visited Cinnamon earlier few times but this time stayed 2 nights with family ( 6th to 8th Jan 2019 ). I like their Hospitable Service. Thank you. The pool bar area is filled with mosquitoes was quite shocked, even complained to the waiter."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Very comfortable bed in a well appointed room. Staff were always extremely friendly and welcoming. Super pool space with plenty of sun loungers. Nice Breakfast buffet. Amazing Sri Lankan village style place ""Nuga Gama"" An oasis of calm in Colombo. Tuk tuk's need to be ordered to Crescat Boulevard as they're not allowed into hotel drop off point...
Touts outside hotel, during late hours, asking if you want Thai ladies...
Breakfast service slightly chaotic due to lack of staff numbers...
"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"A super posh place to stay in Colombo that lives up to all expectations. The room service menu is superb and (by American standards) very cheap. We stayed here as a place to sleep off some jet lag, and I could not have been more satisfied. Highly attentive staff who will help you with pretty much anything. There's a little mall next to the hotel with a fantastic food court."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Location is good and easy to go anywhere in the town. Good internet in the hotel. Nice swimming pool and bar. Good drinks. The staff is attentive. Not a really bad thing, but they use the inside hall (access to your apartment) for celebrations like weddings. It can be quite noisy. Fortunately the bedrooms have really good sound isolation from this area."

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,Very good service and nice food
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.5 ,"Rooms are great and if you enjoy Sri Lankan culture you get to watch some incredible weddings.    It is a great hotel, fantastic food and great outdoor area around the pool.    Fantastic big trees that block most of the city and make you feel that you in an oasis somewhere... pool and the bar are a fantastic escape.   Compare it to bland rooftop exposed and windy pool areas elsewhere... families can stay down in the pool area all day if they wish and totally manned all the time.   Crescat shops attached are also pretty handy and the food court and supermarket in the basement are welcomed escape."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"The variety and choices of fruits, preserves and generally all that was available.And the service by the staffs was marvelous. Nothing."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,The beds were amazing with good quality pillows and sheets. Also the curtains shut out any form of light meaning you could sleep till whenever!

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.8 ,"Excellent service, excellent facilities and amenities, clean and spacious rooms Apart from buffet, restaurants were expensive. If you wanted breakfast the only option was to pay £10 for the buffet.
Food service at the pool was slow, on average 30-40 minutes for a chicken Caesar! Birds around pool area are really annoying and also a health hazard "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Lovely place in a beautiful country Nothing
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.8 ,Very good selections of breakfast. No available king bed size when I checked- in.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.8 ,"Big complex with a lot of conveniences including restaurants, bars, pools etc. Very good breakfast.  Check in took quite a while which was annoying. Transfers to airport organised by the hotel are very expensive compared to outside rates"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.5 ,Excellent food First room was on a smoking floor despite booking a nonsmoking room so we had to be moved
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"What a superb hotel! The staff make this place what it is. They are friendly, courteous and nothing is too much for them. They went out of their way to ensure we had a fantastic stay. The facilities and restaurants around the hotel are stunning and this really is the best place you could want to stay at in Colombo. Nothing."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"The coffee was good, Chutneys the restaurant was amazing as usual. also enjoyed a meal at noodles a Vietnamese restaurant ( zaira assisted in the selection of lovely dishes ) in the hotel. Recommend Gallery cafe approx 2 kms away for continental food.front office Amanda n Steve were very helpful. The Toilet does not have a Jet Spray, very important for us Indians, but they provided us with an alternative pot."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Thought the Reception staff were fantastic - Prabash couldn't have been more helpful.  As this was the second time we had stayed at the Cinnamon Grand in a month, he remembered us and made sure that everything was perfect.  Loved the Pool Bar as I mentioned before....one of my favorite places 'East of Suez'.  The night we arrived went to use the hairdryer and it didn't work - housekeeping were there withing 5 minutes and the dryer was replaced - the next morning went to iron something and the iron didn't work - yet again Housekeeping were there within 5 minutes.....brilliant. Well, the breakfast service could be a little more 'switched on'.  The main staff seem to work extremely hard but the 'suits' seem to be lacking in overall control.  Repeatedly, items would be depleted and one would have to ask....would be lovely to have some fresh orange juice instead of cordial....competitors in Colombo all seem to offer same....."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Excellent breakfastRoom servicegrounds and surroundings Nothing"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Super comfortable room. Huge variety of restaurants and food and very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. A British pub (Cheers) that actually looked like a British pub. Great location, within walking distance of all the main attractions in Colombo. Staff friendly and helpful almost to a fault. Decent gym and a nice swimming pool. Nothing"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Staff There was confusion as to pricing and correspondance from jet wing. This accidentally caused  a very large problem. The staff needed all correspondances from  the main office.

 There was a thin dust in the room and I got a breathing difficulty during my two days stay at the hotel. "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.5 ,Bed was comfy. Staff was friendly Our room had a bad view overlooking the parking and there was a noise coming from the train.  Reception gave our friends who came later a better view but had told us they had nothing better at the time.  Breakfast buffet was average!
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"Comfy bedWell stocked minibar Very noisy basement restaurant,noise from adjacent dance floor"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"Great location and service 
"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Fantastic service from all staff without exception
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.3 ,"The restaurants are superb. Nuga Gama, the village in a forest clearing under a banyan tree, is worth a visit to Colombo on its own. It is a really lovely experience, an enormous range of curries, beautiful lighting, pleasant staff and a live combo playing nice local music.Tao, the Chinese restaurant, is also in a beautiful setting, with fish swimming in ponds around the restaurant. The service is superb; I unfortunately didn't get the names of the delightful and professional managers, but my waiter there twice (Nasitha) could not have been more helpful.The London Grill is an upmarket fine dining restaurant. I didn't feel the service or atmosphere were as good as the restaurants previously mentioned (the candles were not lit; when I asked about them I was told the wrong fuel had been delivered...), but the food was excellent.The room was comfortable and clean, and looked down onto the pool, where there was a very nice bar (Breeze Bar), which was handy day and night for snacks and cocktails. The concierge was horrible and in fact rruined my holiday and made it unlikely I'll return to Sri Lanka.  On checking in I mentioned to the extremely pleasant front desk woman (Leeza) that I needed to get train tickets and she said not to worry about it, the concierge would sort that out. I went to him half an hour later with my 1st 2nd and 3rd choice of tickets for either of two trains on a sheet of paper. He waved it away and said ""Oh no, I'd be on the phone for ages"" (he was busy with nothing else) as there would be confusion over what class seating I would require. I pointed out that everything was very clear on the piece of paper, but he said No, just go to the station ypourself, it's not far. When I got to the station I was told there were no tickets for the day I wanted, though \I could get a ticket back when I needed one. I later returned and bought the return ticket and after a lot of haggling paid a taxi driver over 80 US Doillars to drive me to my destination.(Ella). When I arrived in Ella after a very long drive, a young couple arrived at the same time as me and when I told them about my attempted ticket purchase they said the ticket staff at the station were so rude and unhelpful that they had gone back to their hotel and asked the concierge to help and he had got them tickets. What was really annoying was that not only did I have to pay $80 instead of about $5 for a train ticket, but - even worse - that the concierge was so rude and totally unhelpful.. On my return to Colombo (NOT staying at the Cinnamon Grand) I complained about the incident to a manager called Davina, who lamely said she'd look into it. I pointed out to her that the concierge (a middle-aged man) was hardly likely to admit he had behaved in this way"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Great interconnecting rooms for family. Nothing
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"The property is huge and adjacent to a Shopping Mall, very conveniently located. Reception staff extended our stay till 4 PM on the last day, without even any request from us. Nothing as such"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,Such a great variety of restaurants right on site and great staff!! The room already costs a lot so its too bad that they charge you an extra $25USD / day for an extra cot in your room.  
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"Excellent, special thanks for the courteous staff !! "
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.8 ,Great breakfast. Central location. Helpful staff. A premium room for 3 adults was booked. This was not available on our arrival. Room offered was too small and lower spec. Eventually moved to premium room but third person had to sleep on a camp bed!
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.3 ,"Always a dependable and comfortable stay in Colombo. Central to everything and with great restaurants, if you choose to eat in the hotel. Rooms are good value for money (restaurants are  slightly expensive) and its a hotel that delivers exactly what one would expect of a large property like it."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"14 restaurants to chose from - no need to leave the complex! Lots of staff to look after you, nothing too much trouble: I went to plug my phone in and someone was there to offer to do it for me. I swatted a fly whilst sat in the reception area and registered someone had noticed me -  5 minutes later a ""fly swatter"" had been deployed! OTT but that's what you get for 5 stars."

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Breakfast was a great deal. Superb variety. The hotel is centrally located and extremely popular as a meeting spot for people who aren't guests. The lobby scene is vibrant and active through the late night hours. There are 14 restaurants to choose from, all superb. The quality of the service is outstanding. The hotel staff are friendly and accommodating and always greet you with a smile on meeting you. I couldn't be more pleased with the service here and I will return."

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,"This is an excellent hotel just off the Galle Face Road.      A brilliant swimming pool, nice restaurants and comfortable rooms await.     All of the services and facilities are excellent. The hotel is relatively expensive."

Anything you need is just a call away.  Particularly loved the gym, it is very large and well equipped, with approachable PTs, with nice towels and water.  Location of course is great with a mall built in to the property!  We stayed 4 nights and felt very safe the whole time and enjoyed a stunning wedding reception.  Nothing. "

Wide spread of Breads, pastries and cheese platter's with choices of Tea and coffee suiting one's taste. The poolside bar and restaurant's at the hotel were good stay in hotel option's if one want's to relax. SPA facilities and salon were also good value for money with in the premises.

Very good hoppers, jaggery hoppers and ambarella drink is a must try.  Very convenient location. I really hope that your management will take immediate measures to vaccinate cats around the restaurant or remove them from the area , as you have know idea what I went through due to cat incident.  I am so disappointed and surprised how ignorant you are in relation to this."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.3 ,Strongly recommend having cats in the premises vaccinated as this is a serious health and safety concern for hotel guests

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 7.9 ,"Location was great and central. The hotel has many restaurants and caters for all tastes. Rooms were good and clean. Breakfast selection wasn’t up to the standard of other 5 star hotels in Colombo. The rooms also were okay, bit dated and also not up to the latest standard I’ve experienced of other hotels in Colombo."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,"I particularly wanted to eat at Nuga Gama for my last evening in Colombo - it’s a superb place, serving (to my palate) great local food in an enchanting atmosphere. I also lunched very well at Chutneys. Lovely hotel with very comfortable rooms and a great pool (I only had time to use the main pool, rather than the rooftop one). Noise from main road and railway nearby."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,"Location and facilities are great. Staff is friendly and efficient. Overall a grand experience.  1.There really is no child minder at the Cheers pub which they claim on their in-house marketing material. It’s just a small indoor play room where you have to manage their play. Food and drinks they serve close by. 
The lady who handles the keys to the toys is also the server and you have to wait for her to return to access any toys. 
2.Breakfast is served at the Courtyard restaurant which is too small for a hotel this grand. It’s gets over crowded but the servers do an excellent job"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"I have stayed in many hotels in Colombo and I would say Cinnamon Grand has been the best. Everyone was friendly. Great value for money and the staff is very professional. The deluxe rooms look a bit old, but the premium wing looks fantastic. "

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,"It's a very nice piece of property with a colonial feel. The rooms are a bit outdated but clean and well equipped. Location is great and so is the continental breakfast. The personnel of this hotel is incompetent, to say the least. There is total chaos when it comes to invoice issuing and check-in process. It took us almost an hour to check-in. I specifically asked them to issue an invoice for the company one day before the checkout and they didn't do that. They promised they would send me the invoice but they never did. It's a shame for a 5-star hotel."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,"Hotel ambience My room was at that building where they have continuous event were gng , like corporate , marriage etc , which is very disturbing"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Everyone couldn’t be more friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much and bent over backwards to make sure your stay was a memorable and happy one. Nothing serious - just the distance from rooms to the dinning area for breakfast 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,Staff are super polite and friendly. Very nice hotel with a nice poolside. Check-in took forever. The process for checking in can be streamlined.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.0 ,location and food nothing
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Supporting staff, big area, you can roam around whole day. Every thing was perfect except the same break fast every day. Although the hotel had verity but must be change every day or in 2-3 days like other hotel do."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Everything and even more. Breakfast under my expectations.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Great location. Easy walking to Galle Face Beach, One Galle Face Mall .

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"The staff was amazing, always there to please. We booked on the executive level and it surpassed our expectation of comfort. The Lounge was always filled with something for everyone and the 24 hours breakfast was exceptional. The ambiance was very festive and fun. wished we stayed a bit longer, we had originally booked for 2 nights and changed it last minute."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.6 ,We have stayed here numerous times and we love the location and the rooms. This time we were upgraded to the apartment and it was just what we needed traveling with a toddler. 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"We booked in the VIP level and their breakfast was 24 hours, with excellent choices for Gluten Free and Vegan as well as they were very accommodating to bring us anything we wanted. Wish we had a bit more time, one day wasn't enough"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.2 ,Locations 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,This is a super luxury hotel in Colombo - amongst the very best. The breakfast was out of this world!! Perhaps they shouldn't ask the guests to settle the payment upon arrival.
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,"The Christmas decorations were marvelous! There were many people and the feel of the place was exciting, pulsating! They had a great bakery collection!  The dinner we had, Sri Lankan style in one of their restaurants, which was outside in a village kind of setup. It was raining, the food was cold, vegetarian choices were way less and were not kept separately!! It was very very expensive and that pinched us a lot!!! Even carrying our food to the place of eating was so tough with the rain! 
Faucet was not there in toilet!!"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.0 ,"Check-in it takes to much time. Unbelievable, I’ve never seen something like that.Too boring"

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.0 ,"Good ambience and spacious lobby and rooms. Good menu of typical Sri lankan food tasty at breakfast Check in and check out was time consuming, should be the most time consuming check in and check out. Probably their systems are slow and bad??!!"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Literally a 5 stars hotel in all sense. The rooms are amazing nothing is missing there. The reception and lobby area is so pretty and the food is out of this world. The hotel has a shopping mall next to it or basically in it and 14 restaurants from all around the world. We had new year's eve dinner in the international buffet there and it had a huge variety of meat, sea food, sushi, appetizers and desserts. I believe the price for the buffet with access to the new year's pool party is very reasonable. The decorations the hotel had for Christmas and new year is vert pretty and the new year's party was so festive and amazing with lots of fireworks and lights. This place is highly recommended for celebrations and business trips"
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"Great hotel. Definitely one of the best in Colombo. Top quality. An example of excellent hotel management. 
I hadn’t realised this was one of the places that was targeted in recent (April 2019) incidents. 
Security was top notch and the place felt safe, tranquil and service was impeccable. 
Sad to hear it’s to be turned into a hospital.  Nothing. All good. "

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.0 ,"Cinnamon Grand is one of the older, more established luxury hotels in Colombo. It's got some luxurious digs, but what I think really sets it apart from the rest of the pack are the food options that are available within stone's throw away from the hotel. There are several fantabulous restaurants, serving some of the best cuisine offered by the region within walking distance from this hotel. This, to me, is the main thing that makes this hotel awesome. Apart from that, it's what you would normally expect from a typical high-end hotel, and I think it was pretty good value for money, all things considered."

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,Everything The best hotel 
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 10 ,"The hotel was not very busy even though it was during peak season. The big pool is excellent for kids and Cheers pub has a small playroom. Staff extremely kind and attentive, especially to our 2 kids."
cinnamon-grand-colombo, 9.0 ,"The hotel is very well located in the centre  . The hotel has all the facilities you would expect of this grade of hotel and some very good restaurants. 
The hotel is clean and well maintained. 
The rooms are clean, light and have,everything you need .
I would recommend this hotel to others. The premium rooms seem to vary in size significantly. The sizes on Booking.com are misleading and the  photos seem to be of the larger premium rooms.
We stayed in a premium room about 3 weeks which was quite small and cramped with little space around the bed. This time we again had the premium room but it was totally different and  very spacious . Whilst the larger room is good value for money,  the smaller one certainly  is not. Which you are allocated seems to be pot luck."

cinnamon-grand-colombo, 8.8 ,"We had a problem with noise in our room due to drumming from the event room but this was swiftly and professionally dealt with by Sam, which greatly contributed to a comfortable stay.

lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Spectacular location. Lovely people.
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"One of the most amazing placed we visited during our 2 weeks family vacations in Sri Lanka.The cabanas are very clean and big located and surrounded by wild life. There are plenty of birds flying around, the lake and even flying foxes at dusk.The owners are super friendly and welcoming. Had the best safari experience - the jeep was comfortable and the driver always stopped, showed and told about every animal he saw.We even got a free ride to Tangella which is ~60-70km away. Thank You very much!Highly recommended! Everything was perfect!"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"We only stayed one night, before went early for the safari. The staff was helpful in organising this, even though the safari driver did not tell us much about the animals and the national park, he did not even speak much English. The dinner was fabulous and the rooms are excellent."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Great location for Safari start. They organised everything for us. Lots of good home cooked food all served with a lovely smile.
Our Safari guy was the best. He knew when to wait so we got best and close views of leopards, and saw some great elephant bath times. We feel very privileged. Thanks to all for helping to make our holiday great.  We didn't allow ourselves quite enough time here"
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"There are only four thatched roof log cabins set in a large tropical garden overlooking Tissa lake towards the local stupa. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The grounds are a delight to relax in. The breakfasts, including two packed breakfasts were good, as were the evening meals taken in the garden. The family is very helpful and welcoming. Nothing."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Clean, very good service, perfect home made food, very nice people, away from city. Just perfect, relaxing place with a great view at lake and swimming buffalos."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 9.2 ,"The place is extremely charming for a rustic environment. The family that owns and runs the place is extremely kind and attentive.  The breakfast was simple, but well done.  Dinner was okay as well. Whatever you asked of them they tried to accommodate. They even arranged for the daughters husband to drive me back to Colombo for onlyr 15000 LKR.  It's a six hour journey! Although I'm not much for out-doorsy accommodations, I would definitely stay here again.  Great experience.  The treehouse could use a bit more lighting.  Also, I didn't have any hot water for my showers. 
They could have better guides for the safari. The young woman really didn't answer questions or talk to us much. Maybe she was there to just take pictures. "
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Beautiful setting, wonderful tree cabana. Lot of care for the environment, relaxed and very friendly.Could have stayed forever. We didn't do a safari, just enjoyed the area. Great fish tanks. Can't think of anything."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,"Nice rooms, clean bathrooms, great staffs and delicious Sri Lankan food. Nothing."
lakeside-cabana-tissamaharama, 10 ,Relaxing Place.. Safari was great..
